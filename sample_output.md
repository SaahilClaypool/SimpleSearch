**What is Hydrocephalus?**
=========================

Hydrocephalus is a medical condition characterized by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, leading to increased pressure on the brain. This condition can occur in people of all ages, from infants to adults. According to MedlinePlus, "Hydrocephalus is a buildup of fluid inside the fluid chambers of the brain. The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain." [1]

**Causes of Hydrocephalus**
-------------------------

Hydrocephalus can be caused by a variety of factors, including:

*   Blockage of the flow of CSF
*   Poor absorption of CSF
*   Overproduction of CSF
*   Infections, such as meningitis
*   Trauma or injury to the brain
*   Tumors or cysts in the brain
*   Genetic conditions, such as spina bifida

**Symptoms of Hydrocephalus**
-----------------------------

The symptoms of hydrocephalus can vary depending on the age of the person and the severity of the condition. Common symptoms include:

*   Headache
*   Vomiting
*   Blurry vision
*   Balance problems
*   Bladder control problems
*   Thinking and memory problems

**Diagnosing Hydrocephalus**
---------------------------

Diagnosing hydrocephalus typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and imaging tests. Imaging tests may include:

*   Computed Tomography (CT) scan
*   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan
*   Ultrasound

According to the Mayo Clinic, "Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical exam, MRI findings of ventricular dilation, CSF removal testing and gait assessment." [2]

**Treating Hydrocephalus**
-------------------------

Treatment for hydrocephalus typically involves surgery to relieve the pressure on the brain. The most common surgical procedure is the placement of a shunt, which is a tube that drains excess CSF from the brain to another part of the body. According to MedlinePlus, "Surgery can restore and maintain healthy cerebrospinal fluid levels in the brain. Therapies can manage symptoms resulting from hydrocephalus." [3]

**Curing Hydrocephalus**
----------------------

There is no cure for hydrocephalus, but with proper treatment, it is possible to manage the condition and alleviate symptoms. According to the Mayo Clinic, "If the condition is caught early enough and patients undergo ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, the symptoms can improve. Some individuals are even cured temporarily." [4]

In summary, hydrocephalus is a medical condition characterized by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to increased pressure on the brain. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including blockage of the flow of CSF, poor absorption of CSF, and overproduction of CSF. Symptoms can vary depending on the age of the person and the severity of the condition. Diagnosing hydrocephalus typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and imaging tests. Treatment typically involves surgery to relieve the pressure on the brain, and while there is no cure, proper treatment can help manage the condition and alleviate symptoms.
