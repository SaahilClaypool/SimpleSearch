Hydrocephalus is a condition in which an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) occurs within the brain.[1] This typically causes increased pressure inside the skull. Older people may have headaches, double vision, poor balance, urinary incontinence, personality changes, or mental impairment. In babies, it may be seen as a rapid increase in head size. Other symptoms may include vomiting, sleepiness, seizures, and downward pointing of the eyes.[1]
Hydrocephalus can occur due to birth defects or be acquired later in life.[1] Associated birth defects include neural tube defects and those that result in aqueductal stenosis.[1][4] Other causes include meningitis, brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, intraventricular hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The four types of hydrocephalus are communicating, noncommunicating, ex vacuo, and normal pressure. Diagnosis is typically made by physical examination and medical imaging.[1]
Hydrocephalus is typically treated by the surgical placement of a shunt system.[1] A procedure called a third ventriculostomy is an option in some people.[1] Complications from shunts may include overdrainage, underdrainage, mechanical failure, infection, or obstruction.[1] This may require replacement.[1] Outcomes are variable, but many people with shunts live normal lives.[1] Without treatment, permanent disability or death may occur.[1]
About one to two per 1,000 newborns have hydrocephalus.[1][3] Rates in the developing world may be higher.[5] Normal pressure hydrocephalus is estimated to affect about 5 per 100,000 people, with rates increasing with age.[6] Description of hydrocephalus by Hippocrates dates back more than 2,000 years.[5] The word hydrocephalus is from the Greek ·ΩïŒ¥œâœÅ, hyd≈çr, meaning 'water' and Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ, kephalƒì, meaning 'head'.[7]

The clinical presentation of hydrocephalus varies with chronicity. Acute dilatation of the ventricular system is more likely to manifest with the nonspecific signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). By contrast, chronic dilatation (especially in the elderly population) may have a more insidious onset presenting, for instance, with Hakim's triad (Adams' triad).[8]
Symptoms of increased ICP may include headaches, vomiting, nausea, papilledema, sleepiness, or coma. With increased levels of CSF, there have been cases of hearing loss due to CSF creating pressure on the auditory pathways or disrupting the communication of inner ear fluid.[9] Elevated ICP of different etiologies have been linked to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Transient SNHL has been reported after the loss of CSF with shunt surgeries.[10] Hearing loss is a rare but well-known sequela of procedures resulting in CSF loss.[9] Elevated ICP may result in uncal or tonsillar herniation, with resulting life-threatening brain stem compression.[11]
Hakim's triad of gait instability, urinary incontinence, and dementia is a relatively typical manifestation of the distinct entity normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Focal neurological deficits may also occur, such as abducens nerve palsy and vertical gaze palsy (Parinaud syndrome due to compression of the quadrigeminal plate, where the neural centers coordinating the conjugated vertical eye movement are located). The symptoms depend on the cause of the blockage, the person's age, and how much brain tissue has been damaged by the swelling.[11]
In infants with hydrocephalus, CSF builds up in the central nervous system (CNS), causing the fontanelle (soft spot) to bulge and the head to be larger than expected. Early symptoms may also include:[11]

Eyes that appear to gaze downward
Irritability
Seizures
Separated sutures
Sleepiness
Vomiting
Symptoms that may occur in older children can include:[11]

Brief, shrill, high-pitched cry
Changes in personality, memory, or the ability to reason or think
Changes in facial appearance and eye spacing (craniofacial disproportion)
Crossed eyes or uncontrolled eye movements
Difficulty feeding
Excessive sleepiness
Headaches
Irritability, poor temper control
Loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence)
Loss of coordination and trouble walking
Muscle spasticity (spasm)
Slow growth (child 0‚Äì5 years)
Delayed milestones
Failure to thrive
Slow or restricted movement
Vomiting[12]
Because hydrocephalus can injure the brain, thought and behavior may be adversely affected. Learning disabilities, including short-term memory loss, are common among those with hydrocephalus, who tend to score better on verbal IQ than on performance IQ, which is thought to reflect the distribution of nerve damage to the brain.[1] Hydrocephalus that is present from birth can cause long-term complications with speech and language. Children can have issues such as nonverbal learning disorder, difficulty understanding complex and abstract concepts, difficulty retrieving stored information, and spatial/perceptual disorders. Children with hydrocephalus are often known in having the difficulty in understanding the concepts within conversation and tend to use words they know or have heard.[13][14] However, the severity of hydrocephalus can differ considerably between individuals, and some are of average or above-average intelligence. Someone with hydrocephalus may have coordination and visual problems, or clumsiness. They may reach puberty earlier than the average child (this is called precocious puberty). About one in four develops epilepsy.[15]

Hydrocephalus in a child with kleeblattschadel
Congenital hydrocephalus is present in the infant prior to birth, meaning the fetus developed hydrocephalus in utero during fetal development. The most common cause of congenital hydrocephalus is aqueductal stenosis, which occurs when the narrow passage between the third and fourth ventricles in the brain is blocked or too narrow to allow sufficient cerebral spinal fluid to drain. Fluid accumulates in the upper ventricles, causing hydrocephalus.[16]
Other causes of congenital hydrocephalus include neural-tube defects, arachnoid cysts, Dandy‚ÄìWalker syndrome, and Arnold‚ÄìChiari malformation.
The cranial bones fuse by the end of the third year of life. For head enlargement to occur, hydrocephalus must occur before then. The causes are usually genetic, but can also be acquired and usually occur within the first few months of life, which include intraventricular matrix hemorrhages in premature infants, infections, type II Arnold-Chiari malformation, aqueduct atresia and stenosis, and Dandy-Walker malformation.[17][18] Hydrocephalus can also occur with craniosynostosis, being a constant feature of kleeblattschadel and frequently seen in syndomic cases (mostly in Crouzon syndrome).[19] Hydrocephalus has also been seen in cases of congenital syphilis.[20]
In newborns and toddlers with hydrocephalus, the head circumference is enlarged rapidly and soon surpasses the 97th percentile. Since the skull bones have not yet firmly joined, bulging, firm anterior and posterior fontanelles may be present even when the person is in an upright position.[citation needed]
The infant exhibits fretfulness, poor feeding, and frequent vomiting. As the hydrocephalus progresses, torpor sets in, and infants show lack of interest in their surroundings. Later on, their upper eyelids become retracted and their eyes are turned downwards ("sunset eyes") (due to hydrocephalic pressure on the mesencephalic tegmentum and paralysis of upward gaze). Movements become weak and the arms may become tremulous. Papilledema is absent, but vision may be reduced. The head becomes so enlarged that they eventually may be bedridden.[21]
About 80‚Äì90% of fetuses or newborn infants with spina bifida‚Äîoften associated with meningocele or myelomeningocele‚Äîdevelop hydrocephalus.[22]


This condition is acquired as a consequence of CNS infections, meningitis, brain tumors, head trauma, toxoplasmosis, or intracranial hemorrhage (subarachnoid or intraparenchymal), and is usually painful.[23]


The cause of hydrocephalus is not known with certainty and is probably multifactorial. It may be caused by impaired CSF flow, reabsorption, or excessive CSF production.[24]

Obstruction to CSF flow hinders its free passage through the ventricular system and subarachnoid space (e.g., stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct or obstruction of the interventricular foramina secondary to tumors, hemorrhages, infections or congenital malformations) and can cause increases in ICP.[25]
Hydrocephalus can also be caused by overproduction of CSF (relative obstruction) (e.g., choroid plexus papilloma, villous hypertrophy).[26][27]
Bilateral ureteric obstruction is a rare, but reported, cause of hydrocephalus.
Hydrocephalus can be classified into communicating and noncommunicating (obstructive). Both forms can be either congenital or acquired.[28]


Communicating hydrocephalus, also known as nonobstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by impaired CSF reabsorption in the absence of any obstruction of CSF flow between the ventricles and subarachnoid space. This may be due to functional impairment of the arachnoidal granulations (also called arachnoid granulations or Pacchioni's granulations), which are located along the superior sagittal sinus, and is the site of CSF reabsorption back into the venous system. Various neurologic conditions may result in communicating hydrocephalus, including subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage, meningitis, and congenital absence of arachnoid villi. Scarring and fibrosis of the subarachnoid space following infectious, inflammatory, or hemorrhagic events can also prevent reabsorption of CSF, causing diffuse ventricular dilatation.[29]

Noncommunicating hydrocephalus, or obstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by an obstruction to the flow of CSF.[30]

Foramen of Monro obstruction may lead to dilation of one, or if large enough (e.g., in colloid cyst), both lateral ventricles.
The aqueduct of Sylvius, normally narrow, may be obstructed by a number of genetic or acquired lesions (e.g., atresia, ependymitis, hemorrhage, or tumor) and lead to dilation of both lateral ventricles, as well as the third ventricle.
Fourth ventricle obstruction leads to dilatation of the aqueduct, as well as the lateral and third ventricles (e.g., Chiari malformation).
The foramina of Luschka and foramen of Magendie may be obstructed due to congenital malformation (e.g., Dandy‚ÄìWalker malformation).

Hydrocephalus ex vacuo from vascular dementia as seen on MRI
Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a particular form of chronic communicating hydrocephalus, characterized by enlarged cerebral ventricles, with only intermittently elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Characteristic triad of symptoms are; dementia, apraxic gait and urinary incontinence. The diagnosis of NPH can be established only with the help of continuous intraventricular pressure recordings (over 24 hours or even longer), since more often than not instant measurements yield normal pressure values. Dynamic compliance studies may be also helpful. Altered compliance (elasticity) of the ventricular walls, as well as increased viscosity of the cerebrospinal fluid, may play a role in the pathogenesis.[31]
Hydrocephalus ex vacuo also refers to an enlargement of cerebral ventricles and subarachnoid spaces, and is usually due to brain atrophy (as it occurs in dementias), post-traumatic brain injuries, and even in some psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.[32] As opposed to hydrocephalus, this is a compensatory enlargement of the CSF-spaces in response to brain parenchyma loss; it is not the result of increased CSF pressure.[32]

3D cast of lateral ventricles in hydrocephalus
Hydrocephalus is usually due to blockage of CSF outflow in the ventricles or in the subarachnoid space over the brain. In a person without hydrocephalus, CSF continuously circulates through the brain, its ventricles and the spinal cord and is continuously drained away into the circulatory system. Alternatively, the condition may result from an overproduction of the CSF, from a congenital malformation blocking normal drainage of the fluid, or from complications of head injuries or infections.[34]
Compression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually may cause neurological symptoms such as convulsions, intellectual disability, and epileptic seizures. These signs occur sooner in adults, whose skulls are no longer able to expand to accommodate the increasing fluid volume within. Fetuses, infants, and young children with hydrocephalus typically have an abnormally large head, excluding the face, because the pressure of the fluid causes the individual skull bones‚Äîwhich have yet to fuse‚Äîto bulge outward at their juncture points. Another medical sign, in infants, is a characteristic fixed downward gaze with whites of the eyes showing above the iris, as though the infant were trying to examine its own lower eyelids.[35]
The elevated ICP may cause compression of the brain, leading to brain damage and other complications. A complication often overlooked is the possibility of hearing loss due to ICP. The mechanism of ICP on hearing loss is presumed that the transmission of CSF pressure to and from the Perilymphatic space through a patent cochlear aqueduct.[36][37] The cochlear aqueduct connects the Perilymphatic space of the inner ear with the subarachnoid space of the posterior cranial fossa.[38] A loss of CSF pressure can induce Perilymphatic loss or endolymphatic hydrops resembling the clinical presentation of M√©ni√®re's disease associated hearing loss in the low frequencies.[36]
CSF can accumulate within the ventricles, this condition is called internal hydrocephalus and may result in increased CSF pressure. The production of CSF continues, even when the passages that normally allow it to exit the brain are blocked. Consequently, fluid builds inside the brain, causing pressure that dilates the ventricles and compresses the nervous tissue. Compression of the nervous tissue usually results in irreversible brain damage. If the skull bones are not completely ossified when the hydrocephalus occurs, the pressure may also severely enlarge the head. The cerebral aqueduct may be blocked at the time of birth or may become blocked later in life because of a tumor growing in the brainstem.[39]



Baby recovering from shunt surgery
Hydrocephalus treatment is surgical, creating a way for the excess fluid to drain away. In the short term, an external ventricular drain (EVD), also known as an extraventricular drain or ventriculostomy, provides relief. In the long term, some people will need any of various types of cerebral shunt. It involves the placement of a ventricular catheter (a tube made of silastic) into the cerebral ventricles to bypass the flow obstruction/malfunctioning arachnoidal granulations and drain the excess fluid into other body cavities, from where it can be resorbed. Most shunts drain the fluid into the peritoneal cavity (ventriculoperitoneal shunt), but alternative sites include the right atrium (ventriculoatrial shunt), pleural cavity (ventriculopleural shunt), and gallbladder.

Further information on the non-invasive diagnostic medical device: ShuntCheck
A shunt system can also be placed in the lumbar space of the spine and have the CSF redirected to the peritoneal cavity (lumbar-peritoneal shunt).[40] An alternative treatment for obstructive hydrocephalus in selected people is the endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), whereby a surgically created opening in the floor of the third ventricle allows the CSF to flow directly to the basal cisterns, thereby shortcutting any obstruction, as in aqueductal stenosis. This may or may not be appropriate based on individual anatomy. For infants, ETV is sometimes combined with choroid plexus cauterization, which reduces the amount of cerebrospinal fluid produced by the brain. The technique, known as ETV/CPC, was pioneered in Uganda by neurosurgeon Benjamin Warf and is now in use in several U.S. hospitals.[41][42] Hydrocephalus can be successfully treated by placing a drainage tube (shunt) between the brain ventricles and abdominal cavity. Some risk exists of infection being introduced into the brain through these shunts, as they must be replaced as the person grows.[43][44]

External hydrocephalus[edit]
External hydrocephalus is a condition generally seen in infants which involves enlarged fluid spaces or subarachnoid spaces around the outside of the brain. This condition is generally benign, and resolves spontaneously by two years of age[45] and therefore usually does not require insertion of a shunt. Imaging studies and a good medical history can help to differentiate external hydrocephalus from subdural hemorrhages or symptomatic chronic extra-axial fluid collections which are accompanied by vomiting, headaches, and seizures.[46][47]

Shunt complications[edit]
Examples of possible complications include shunt malfunction, shunt failure, and shunt infection, along with infection of the shunt tract following surgery (the most common reason for shunt failure is infection of the shunt tract). Although a shunt generally works well, it may stop working if it disconnects, becomes blocked (clogged) or infected, or it is outgrown. If this happens, the CSF begins to accumulate again and a number of physical symptoms develop (headaches, nausea, vomiting, photophobia/light sensitivity), some extremely serious, such as seizures. The shunt failure rate is also relatively high (of the 40,000 surgeries performed annually to treat hydrocephalus, only 30% are a person's first surgery) and people not uncommonly have multiple shunt revisions within their lifetimes.[48]
Another complication can occur when CSF drains more rapidly than it is produced by the choroid plexus, causing symptoms of listlessness, severe headaches, irritability, light sensitivity, auditory hyperesthesia (sound sensitivity), hearing loss,[38] nausea, vomiting, dizziness, vertigo, migraines, seizures, a change in personality, weakness in the arms or legs, strabismus, and double vision to appear when the person is vertical. If the person lies down, the symptoms usually vanish quickly. A CT scan may or may not show any change in ventricle size, particularly if the person has a history of slit-like ventricles. Difficulty in diagnosing over-drainage can make treatment of this complication particularly frustrating for people and their families. Resistance to traditional analgesic pharmacological therapy may also be a sign of shunt overdrainage or failure.[49]
Following placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt there have been cases of a decrease in post-surgery hearing. It is presumed that the cochlea aqueduct is responsible for the decrease in hearing thresholds. The cochlea aqueduct has been considered as a probable channel where CSF pressure can be transmitted. Therefore, the reduced CSF pressure could cause a decrease in Perilymphatic pressure and cause secondary endolymphatic hydrops.[38] In addition to the increased hearing loss, there have also been findings of resolved hearing loss after ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, where there is a release of CSF pressure on the auditory pathways.[50]
The diagnosis of CSF buildup is complex and requires specialist expertise. Diagnosis of the particular complication usually depends on when the symptoms appear, that is, whether symptoms occur when the person is upright or in a prone position, with the head at roughly the same level as the feet.[51]
Standardized protocols for inserting cerebral shunts have been shown to reduce shunt infections.[52][53] There is tentative evidence that preventative antibiotics may decrease the risk of shunt infections.[54]


The hydrocephalus disease burden are concentrated in the developing world while North America has the least number of cases. A systematic review in 2019 estimated that there are 180,000 childhood hydrocephalus cases from the African continent per year, followed by 90,000 cases from Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. Latin America also has a high prevalence of hydrocephalus. However, data on hydrocephalus disease burden in adults are lacking.[55]


Skull of a hydrocephalic child (1800s)
In the pre-historic area, there were various paintings or artifacts depicting children or adults with macrocephaly (large head) or clinical findings of hydrocephalus.[56] The earliest scientific description of hydrocephalus was written by the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, who coined the word 'hydrocephalus' from the Greek ·ΩïŒ¥œâœÅ, hyd≈çr meaning 'water' and Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ, kephalƒì meaning 'head'.[57] A more accurate description was later given by the Roman physician Galen in the second century AD.[57]
The first clinical description of an operative procedure for hydrocephalus appears in the Al-Tasrif (1,000 AD) by the Arab surgeon Abulcasis, who described the evacuation of superficial intracranial fluid in hydrocephalic children.[57] He described it in his chapter on neurosurgical disease, describing infantile hydrocephalus as being caused by mechanical compression. He wrote:[57]

The skull of a newborn baby is often full of liquid, either because the matron has compressed it excessively or for other, unknown reasons. The volume of the skull then increases daily, so that the bones of the skull fail to close. In this case, we must open the middle of the skull in three places, make the liquid flow out, then close the wound and tighten the skull with a bandage.
Historical specimen of an infant with severe hydrocephalus, probably untreated
In 1881, a few years after the landmark study of Retzius and Key, Carl Wernicke pioneered sterile ventricular puncture and external drainage of CSF for the treatment of hydrocephalus.[57] It remained an intractable condition until the 20th century, when cerebral shunt and other neurosurgical treatment modalities were developed.[citation needed]

Society and culture[edit]

The word hydrocephalus is from the Greek ·ΩïŒ¥œâœÅ, hyd≈çr meaning 'water' and Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ, kephalƒì meaning 'head'.[7] Other names for hydrocephalus include "water on the brain", a historical name, and "water baby syndrome".[1][58]


Hydrocephalus awareness ribbon
September was designated National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month in July 2009 by the U.S. Congress in H.Res. 373. The resolution campaign is due in part to the advocacy work of the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foundation. Prior to July 2009, no awareness month for this condition had been designated. Many hydrocephalus organizations, such as the One Small Voice Foundation, promote awareness and fundraising activities.[citation needed]


One case of hydrocephalus was a man whose brain shrank to a thin sheet of tissue, due to a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in his skull. As a child, the man had a shunt, but it was removed when he was 14. In July 2007, at age 44, he went to a hospital due to mild weakness in his left leg. When doctors learned of the man's medical history, they performed a CT and MRI scan, and were astonished to see "massive enlargement" of the lateral ventricles in the skull. Dr. Lionel Feuillet of H√¥pital de la Timone in Marseille said, "The images were most unusual... the brain was virtually absent."[59] Intelligence tests showed the person had an IQ of 75, considered "Borderline intellectual functioning", just above what would be officially classified as intellectually disabled.[60][61]
The person was a married father of two children, and worked as a civil servant, leading an at least superficially normal life, despite having enlarged ventricles with a decreased volume of brain tissue. "What I find amazing to this day is how the brain can deal with something which you think should not be compatible with life", commented Dr. Max Muenke, a pediatric brain-defect specialist at the National Human Genome Research Institute. "If something happens very slowly over quite some time, maybe over decades, the different parts of the brain take up functions that would normally be done by the part that is pushed to the side."[62][63][64]


Ice hockey player Colby Cave had acute obstructive hydrocephalus due to a colloid cyst.[65]
Author Sherman Alexie, born with the condition, wrote about it in his semi-autobiographical junior fiction novel The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian.[66]
Prince William, Duke of Gloucester (1689‚Äì1700), probably contracted meningitis at birth, which resulted in this condition.[67]
Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria (1793‚Äì1875) became emperor in 1835 despite various health issues including hydrocephalus and epilepsy.[citation needed]
In the American folklore of the states of Ohio, Michigan, and Connecticut, an urban legend exists about the melon heads, the inbred descendants of families of people born with hydrocephaly.
Masato Kudo, a professional soccer player, died of hydrocephalus on October 21, 2022.

**What is Hydrocephalus?**

Hydrocephalus is a condition in which an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) occurs within the brain. This typically causes increased pressure inside the skull. Older people may have headaches, double vision, poor balance, urinary incontinence, personality changes, or mental impairment. In babies, it may be seen as a rapid increase in head size. Other symptoms may include vomiting, sleepiness, seizures, and downward pointing of the eyes.

**Diagnosis**

Diagnosis is typically made by physical examination and medical imaging. The four types of hydrocephalus are communicating, noncommunicating, ex vacuo, and normal pressure.

**Treatment**

Hydrocephalus is typically treated by the surgical placement of a shunt system. A procedure called a third ventriculostomy is an option in some people. Complications from shunts may include overdrainage, underdrainage, mechanical failure, infection, or obstruction. This may require replacement. Outcomes are variable, but many people with shunts live normal lives. Without treatment, permanent disability or death may occur.

**Types of Hydrocephalus**

Communicating hydrocephalus, also known as nonobstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by impaired CSF reabsorption in the absence of any obstruction of CSF flow between the ventricles and subarachnoid space. Noncommunicating hydrocephalus, or obstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by an obstruction to the flow of CSF.

**Treatment Options**

In the short term, an external ventricular drain (EVD), also known as an extraventricular drain or ventriculostomy, provides relief. In the long term, some people will need any of various types of cerebral shunt. It involves the placement of a ventricular catheter (a tube made of silastic) into the cerebral ventricles to bypass the flow obstruction/malfunctioning arachnoidal granulations and drain the excess fluid into other body cavities, from where it can be resorbed.

Normal-pressure hydrocephalusOther namesMalresorptive hydrocephalusSpecialtyNeurology 
Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), also called malresorptive hydrocephalus, is a form of communicating hydrocephalus in which excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the ventricles, leading to normal or slightly elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The fluid build-up causes the ventricles to enlarge and the pressure inside the head to increase, compressing surrounding brain tissue and leading to neurological complications. Although the cause of idiopathic (also referred to as primary) NPH remains unclear, it has been associated with various co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and hyperlipidemia.[1][2][3] Causes of secondary NPH include trauma, hemorrhage, or infection.[4] The disease presents in a classic triad of symptoms, which are memory impairment, urinary frequency, and balance problems/gait deviations (note: this diagnosis method is obsolete[5][6]). The disease was first described by Salom√≥n Hakim and Raymond Adams in 1965.[7]
The treatment is surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to drain excess CSF into the lining of the abdomen where the CSF will eventually be absorbed. NPH is often misdiagnosed as other conditions including Meniere's disease (due to balance problems), Parkinson's disease (due to gait) or Alzheimer's disease (due to cognitive dysfunction).



NPH exhibits a classic triad of clinical findings (known as the Adams triad or Hakim's triad). The triad consists of walking difficulty, reduced attention span, and urinary frequency or incontinence. Symptoms present insidiously over the course of 3‚Äì6 months.[4] The triad is considered obsolete for diagnostic purposes and newer guidelines are available.[5][6]
Gait deviations/balance problems are present in nearly all NPH patients and are typically the first presenting symptom. This is caused by expansion of the lateral ventricles, which can impinge on the corticospinal tract motor fibers. The typical gait abnormality in NPH is a broad-based, slow, short-stepped, "stuck to the floor", or "magnetic" movement. The gait abnormalities in NPH may bear resemblance to a gait associated with Parkinson's disease. The gait deviation can be classified as mild, marked, or severe: "marked" is when the patient has difficulty walking because of considerable instability; "severe" is when it is not possible for the patient to walk without aids (such as a cane or a wheeled walker).[8][9] An associated tremor of the hands, legs, or feet can be seen in up to 40% of NPH patients.[10]
Dementia presents as progressive cognitive impairment which is present in 60% of patients at time of treatment. This is caused by distortions predominantly at the frontal lobe and the subcortex.[11] Initial deficits involve planning, organization, attention, and concentration. Further deficits include difficulty managing finances, taking medications, driving, keeping track of appointments, daytime sleeping, short-term memory impairments, and psychomotor slowing. Late-stage features include apathy, reduced drive, slowed thinking, and reduced speech.
Urinary incontinence appears late in the illness and is present in 50% of patients at time of treatment. Urinary dysfunction begins as increased frequency often at night and progresses to urge incontinence and permanent incontinence.[11]


Every day, the body makes roughly 600‚Äì700 ml of CSF, and about the same amount is reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Hydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance between the amount of fluid produced and its absorption rate. Enlarged ventricles put increased pressure on the adjacent cortical tissue and cause myriad effects in the patient, including distortion of the fibers in the corona radiata. This leads to an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). The ICP gradually falls but remains slightly elevated, and the CSF pressure reaches a high normal level of 15 to 20 cm H2O. Measurements of ICP, therefore, are not usually elevated. Because of this, patients do not exhibit the classic signs that accompany increased intracranial pressure such as headache, nausea, vomiting, or altered consciousness, although some studies have shown pressure elevations to occur intermittently.[12][13]
The exact pathogenesis is unknown, but consensus on some mechanisms include:[14]

An imbalance exists between production and resorption of CSF.
The resistance to CSF outflow is often elevated.
The disease is not caused by overproduction of CSF or obstruction of CSF flow at the ventricles.[14]
The syndrome is often divided into two groups, primary (also called idiopathic) and secondary, based on cause. The underlying etiology of primary NPH has not yet been identified. Primary NPH affects adults age 40 years or older, most commonly in adults over 60.[15] Secondary NPH can affect persons of any age and occurs due to conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, brain surgery, brain radiation, or traumatic brain injury.[16] These conditions are thought to lead to increased inflammation of the arachnoid granulations, which further leads to decreased CSF reabsorption and therefore enlargement of ventricles.[17]
Symptoms of gait deviation, neurological impairment, and urinary incontinence seen in NPH are due to compression of the corresponding regions of the brain that control these functions. Gait abnormalities are thought to be due to compression of the corticospinal tract fibers in the corona radiata that coordinate motor movements of the legs.[14] Compression of the brainstem as well as poor perfusion of the periventricular white matter in the prefrontal cortex are also thought to contribute to gait deviations in NPH.[14] Dementia in NPH is most likely caused by ventricular enlargement compressing the calvarium, which further leads to tearing of currently unidentified nerve fibers.[14] Lastly, urinary incontinence is thought to be caused by stretching of the periventricular sacral fibers of the corticospinal tract fibers leading to loss of voluntary bladder contraction.[14][18]


Evan's index is the ratio of maximum width of the frontal horns to the maximum width of the inner table of the cranium. An Evan's index more than 0.31 indicates hydrocephalus.[19]
Patients with suspected idiopathic NPH should have at least one of the symptoms in Hakim's triad (gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment) in addition to ventricular enlargement on neuroimaging. An extensive and detailed patient history is required in order to exclude other diseases that may explain the patient's symptoms. Known causes of secondary NPH (head injury, meningitis, hemorrhage) should be ruled out prior to further investigation of idiopathic NPH.[4]
The international evidenced-based diagnostic criteria for primary, or idiopathic, NPH are:[20]

Gradual onset after age 40 years, symptoms duration of ‚â• 3‚Äì6 months, clinical evidence of gait or balance impairment, and impairment of cognition or urinary incontinence
Imaging from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) is needed to demonstrate enlarged ventricles and no macroscopic obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid flow.  Imaging should show an enlargement to at least one of the temporal horns of lateral ventricles, and impingement against the falx cerebri resulting in a callosal angle ‚â§ 90¬∞ on the coronal view, showing evidence of altered brain water content, or normal active flow (which is referred to as "flow void") at the cerebral aqueduct and fourth ventricle.

Typical imaging findings in normal pressure hydrocephalus versus brain atrophy.[21]

Transependymal cerebrospinal fluid diapedesis

Vascular encephalopathy, in this case suggested by unilateral occurrence

MRI scans are the preferred imaging. The distinction between normal and enlarged ventricular size by cerebral atrophy is difficult to ascertain. Up to 80% of cases are unrecognized and untreated due to difficulty of diagnosis.[22] Imaging should also reveal the absence of any cerebral mass lesions or any signs of obstructions. Although all patients with NPH have enlarged ventricles, not all elderly patients with enlarged ventricles have primary NPH. Cerebral atrophy can cause enlarged ventricles, as well, and is referred to as hydrocephalus ex vacuo.

Image of patient receiving lumbar puncture (LP). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from an LP can be tested to aid in the diagnosis of NPH.
The Miller Fisher test involves a high-volume lumbar puncture (LP) with removal of 30‚Äì50 ml of CSF. Gait and cognitive function are typically tested just before and within 2‚Äì3 hours after the LP to assess for signs of symptomatic improvement. The CSF infusion test can also be used to aid in diagnosis of NPH. During the CSF infusion test, a ringer lactate solution is infused into a spinal needle while another spinal needle is used to record numerous CSF pressure variables including ICP, outflow resistance, and CSF formation rate.[23] The tests have a positive predictive value over 90%, but a negative predictive value less than 50%. The LP should show normal or mildly elevated CSF pressure. CSF should have normal cell contents, glucose levels, and protein levels.[24][25][26]


Ventriculoperitoneal shunts[edit]
Diagram demonstrating surgical placement of a VP shunt used to manage NPH.
For suspected cases of NPH, CSF shunting is the first-line treatment. The most common type used to treat NPH is ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts, which drain CSF fluid to the peritoneal cavity. Adjustable valves allow fine-tuning of CSF drainage. NPH symptoms reportedly improve in 70‚Äì90% of patients with CSF shunt. Risk-benefit analyses have shown beyond any doubt that surgery for NPH is far better than conservative treatment or the natural course.[22] VP shunt is less likely to be recommended in those who have severe dementia at time of NPH diagnosis, regardless of findings found on MRI or CT.[10][27]
Gait symptoms improve in ‚â• 85% patients. Cognitive symptoms improve in up to 80% of patients when surgery is performed early in the disease course. Urgency and incontinence improve in up to 80% of patients, but only in ‚â§ 50‚Äì60% of patients with shunt implanted late in disease course. The most likely patients to show improvement are those who show only gait deviation, mild or no incontinence, and mild dementia. The risk of adverse events related to shunt placement is 11%, including shunt failure, infections such as ventriculitis, shunt obstruction, over- or under-drainage, and development of a subdural hematoma.[28][29][30]


No medications are effective for primary NPH. Lasting reductions in ICP have not been demonstrated with acetazolamide.[31] Transient reduction in ICP after administration of an acetazolamide bolus has been shown to be a positive predictor for good response after VP shunt placement in NPH patients.
Research is currently aimed at finding other medication options for the management of NPH symptoms. Steroids have demonstrated decreased production of CSF in animal studies on healthy rabbits and dogs, however further testing is required to determine if this is an effective treatment option in humans.[32][33][34] A trial of triamterene in adults with chronic hydrocephalus has also shown improvement of symptoms within 12 weeks, however further research is needed to support this as a non-surgical option for NPH.[32]

Outcomes and Prognosis[edit]
The prognosis for patients with NPH varies depending on cause, severity of symptoms, and time to diagnosis. If left untreated, symptoms of gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence may continue to worsen and ultimately lead to death. Patients with a successful VP shunt can live a typically normal life with no restrictions to activities of daily living.[35] According to a recent study, gait imbalance appears to be the symptom that improves the most for patients after placement of a VP shunt.[36]


Approximately half of all cases are primary (or idiopathic) NPH.[15] Incidence is estimated to 0.3‚Äì3% in patients older than 60 years and raising with older age.[37] Its prevalence is reported to be less than 1% in persons under the age of 65, and up to 3% for persons aged 65 or older. No difference in incidence is seen between men and women or amongst differing ethnicities.[38][11][39][40] Among individuals with dementia, the incidence of NPH is thought to be between 2 and 6%.


NPH was first described by neurosurgeon Salom√≥n Hakim in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios, located in Bogot√°, Colombia. Hakim was contacted by the family of a 16-year-old male patient who, after suffering from severe head trauma in a motor vehicle accident, remained semi-comatose after surgery to relieve pressure from a subdural hematoma. Hakim soon discovered ventricular enlargement on imaging of the patient, however, the patient's intracranial pressure remained within normal limits. Hakim decided to remove CSF for laboratory testing and later implanted a ventriculoatrial shunt, after which the patient showed significant improvement to Hakim's surprise. These findings were later published as a case report by Hakim in 1964 in The New England Journal of Medicine. Hakim continued to research and work with patients found to have NPH and later published his findings detailing the classic triad of gait disturbance, neurological impairment, and urinary incontinence.[41]

Verbatim sections:

Hydrocephalus is a condition where excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the brain, leading to increased pressure.

Hydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance between the amount of fluid produced and its absorption rate. Enlarged ventricles put increased pressure on the adjacent cortical tissue and cause myriad effects in the patient, including distortion of the fibers in the corona radiata. This leads to an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). The ICP gradually falls but remains slightly elevated, and the CSF pressure reaches a high normal level of 15 to 20 cm H2O.

Diagnosis of Hydrocephalus is typically made using imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans. These studies can show enlarged ventricles and no macroscopic obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid flow.

Treatment of Hydrocephalus typically involves the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to drain excess CSF from the brain to the peritoneal cavity. The shunt is adjusted to allow for fine-tuning of CSF drainage, and the patient is monitored for improvement in symptoms.

Cerebral shuntA diagram of a typical brain shuntMeSHD002557[edit on Wikidata]
A cerebral shunt is a device permanently implanted inside the head and body to drain excess fluid away from the brain. They are commonly used to treat hydrocephalus, the swelling of the brain due to excess buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). If left unchecked, the excess CSF can lead to an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), which can cause intracranial hematoma, cerebral edema, crushed brain tissue or herniation.[1] The drainage provided by a shunt can alleviate or prevent these problems in patients with hydrocephalus or related diseases.
Shunts come in a variety of forms, but most of them consist of a valve housing connected to a catheter, the lower end of which is usually placed in the peritoneal cavity. The main differences between shunts are usually in the materials used to construct them, the types of valve (if any) used, and whether the valve is programmable or not.[2]

Valve type

Description


Delta

Designed to prevent overdrainage. Remains closed until ICP reaches a predetermined level. Leaves shunted ventricle larger than the non-shunted ventricles.[3][4]


Medium pressure cylindrical

Can lead to uneven drainage of ventricles.[3]


Nulsen and Spitz

Contains two ball-valve units connected with a spring. Does not have an adjustable pressure setting. First mass-produced valve used to treat hydrocephalus in 1956.[5]


Spitz-Holter

Uses slits in silicone to avoid mechanical failure.[6][7]


Anti-siphon

Prevents over drainage by preventing the siphon effect. The device closes when the pressure within the valve becomes negative relative to the ambient pressure. Prevents overdrainage that might occur when a patient sits, stands or rapidly changes posture.[8]


Sigma

The Sigma valve operates on a flow-control mechanism as opposed to the pressure-control system of other valves. The device can regulate CSF flow changes without being programmed or surgically changed. The first iteration was introduced in 1987. Valve operated in three stages to prevent over and under drainage.[9]


X-ray of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt
The location of the shunt is determined by the neurosurgeon based on the type and location of the blockage causing hydrocephalus. All brain ventricles are candidates for shunting. The catheter is most commonly placed in the abdomen but other locations include the heart and lungs.[10] Shunts can often be named after the route used by the neurosurgeon. The distal end of the catheter can be located in just about any tissue with enough epithelial cells to absorb the incoming CSF. Below are some common routing plans for cerebral shunts.


It is located on the parietal bone, above the lambdoid suture, 3 to 4 cm lateral to the midline and 6 cm above the inion.[11] It is a common site for ventricular cannulation in the context of inserting a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for the treatment of hydrocephalus. It was first described by C H Frazier in 1928.[12]

The surgeon forms a pocket beneath the epicranial aponeurosis (the subgaleal space) and allows CSF to drain from the ventricles, creating a fluid-filled swelling on the baby's scalp. These shunts are normally converted to VP or other shunt types once the infant is big enough.[13]


Below is a short list of known complications that can lead to hydrocephalus requiring shunting.




Diagnoses

Description

Incidence


Congenital hydrocephalus

A wide range of genetic abnormalities that could lead to hydrocephalus at birth.

0.04‚Äì0.08%[14]


Tumor

A number of different tumors can lead to CSF blockage if they are located in certain areas. Some of these areas include the lateral or third ventricles, the posterior fossa, and intraspinal tumors. The tumors may be malignant or benign.[15]

Unknown


Post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus

Bleeding into the ventricles of the brain, especially in infancy, can lead to blockage of CSF drainage and cause hydrocephalus.


Spina bifida

Specifically spina bifida myelomeningocele can cause the development of hydrocephalus because the cerebellum will block the flow of CSF in a development of Chiari Malformation II.

0.125%[16]


Congenital aqueductal stenosis

A genetic disorder which can cause deformations of the nervous system. The defect is commonly associated with intellectual disability, abducted thumbs and spastic paraplegia.[14]

0.003%[14]


Craniosynostosis

Craniosynostosis occurs when the sutures of the skull close too early. The result of multiple sutures fusing before the brain stops growing is an increase in ICP leading to hydrocephalus.[17]

0.05%[18]


Post-meningitic hydrocephalus

The inflammation and scarring caused by meningitis can inhibit CSF absorption.


Dandy‚ÄìWalker syndrome

Patients usually present with a cystic deformity of the fourth ventricle, hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, and an enlarged posterior fossa. The condition is a genetically heritable disease.[19]

0.003%[20]


Arachnoid cyst

A defect caused when CSF forms a collection that is trapped in the arachnoid membranes. The resulting cyst can then block the normal flow of CSF from the brain resulting in hydrocephalus as well as other defects. The most common locations for an arachnoid cyst are the middle fossa and the posterior fossa. The most common symptoms are nausea and vertigo.[21]

0.05%[22]


Idiopathic intracranial hypertension

A rare neurological disorder affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 people, most of whom are women of child-bearing age. IIH results in a raised intracranial pressure and can lead to permanent loss of vision.




Normal pressure hydrocephalus, also known as Hakim-Adams syndrome

Excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) occurs in the ventricles, and with normal or slightly elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure




There are a number of complications associated with shunt placement. Many of these complications occur during childhood and cease once the patient has reached adulthood. Many of the complications require immediate shunt revision (the replacement or reprogramming of the already existing shunt). The common symptoms often resemble a new onset of hydrocephalus, such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, double vision, and an alteration of consciousness. This can result in damage to an individual's short-term memory.[10] In the pediatric population, the shunt failure rate two years after implantation has been estimated to be as high as 50%.[23] Those patients with advanced age, prolonged hospital stay, GCS score of less than 13, extra-ventricular drains in situ, or excision of brain tumors are more likely to have early shunt malfunction.[24]


Infection is a common complication that normally affects pediatric patients because they have not yet built up immunities to a number of different diseases. Normally, the incidence of infection decreases as the patient grows older and the body gains immunity to various infectious agents.[10] 
Shunt infection can occur in up to 27% of patients. Infection can lead to long term cognitive defects, neurological problems, and in some cases death. Common microbial agents for shunt infection include Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. Further factors that can lead to shunt infection include shunt insertion at a young age (less than six months old) and the type of hydrocephalus being treated. There is no strong correlation between infection and shunt type.[25]
Though the symptoms of a shunt infection are generally similar to the symptoms seen in hydrocephalus, infection symptoms can also include fever and elevated white blood cell counts.[26]

Treatment of shunt infections[edit]
Treatment of a CSF shunt infection generally includes removal of the shunt and placement of a temporary ventricular reservoir until the infection is resolved.[27][28] There are four main methods of treating ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt infections: (1) antibiotics; (2) removal of infected shunt with immediate replacement; (3) externalization of shunt with eventual replacement; (4) removal of infected shunt with external ventricular drain (EVD) placement and eventual shunt re-insertion. The last method has the highest success rate at over 95%.[29]

Medical treatment of shunt infection[edit]
Initial empiric therapy for CSF shunt infection should include broad antibiotic coverage for gram-negative aerobic bacilli including pseudomonas as well as for gram-positive organisms including Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, such as a combination of ceftazidime and vancomycin. Some clinicians add parenteral or intrathecal aminoglycosides to enhance pseudomonas coverage, although the efficacy of the aminoglycosides is not clear. Meropenem and aztreonam are additional antibiotic options that are effective against gram-negative bacterial infections.[30]

Surgical treatment of shunt infection[edit]
To evaluate the benefit of surgical shunt removal or externalization followed by removal, Wong et al. compared two groups: one with medical treatment alone, and another with medical and surgical treatment simultaneously. 28 patients with infection after ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation over an 8-year period in their neurosurgical center were studied. 17 of these patients were treated with shunt removal or externalization followed by removal in addition to IV antibiotics while the other 11 were treated with IV antibiotics only. The group receiving both surgical shunt removal and antibiotics showed lower mortality ‚Äì 19% versus 42% (p = 0.231). Despite the fact that these results are not statistically significant, Wong et al. suggest managing VP shunt infections via both surgical and medical treatment.[31]
An analysis of 17 studies published over the past 30 years regarding children with CSF shunt infections revealed that treating with both shunt removal and antibiotics successfully treated 88% of 244 infections, while antibiotic therapy alone successfully treated the CSF shunt infection in only 33% of 230 infections.[28][32]
While typical surgical methods of handling VP shunt infections involve removal and reimplantation of the shunt, different types of operations have used with success in select patients. 
Steinbok et al. treated a case of recurrent VP shunt infections in an eczematous patient with a ventriculosubgaleal shunt for two months until the eczema healed completely. This type of shunt allowed them to avoid the area of diseased skin that acted as the source of infection.[29]
Jones et al. have treated 4 patients with non-communicating hydrocephalus who had VP shunt infections with shunt removal and third ventriculostomy. These patients were cured of the infection and have not required shunt re-insertion, thus showing the effectiveness of this procedure in these types of patients.[33]


Another leading cause of shunt failure is a blockage of the shunt at either the proximal or distal end. At the proximal end, the shunt valve can become blocked due to the buildup of excess protein in the CSF. The extra protein will collect at the point of drainage and slowly clog the valve. The shunt can also become blocked at the distal end if the shunt is pulled out of the abdominal cavity (in the case of VP shunts), or from similar protein buildup. Other causes of blockage are overdrainage and slit ventricle syndrome.[10]


Over drainage occurs when a shunt has not been adequately designed for the particular patient. Overdrainage can lead to a number of different complications some of which are highlighted below.
Usually one of two types of overdrainage can occur. First, when the CSF drains too rapidly, a condition known as extra-axial fluid collection can occur. In this condition the brain collapses on itself resulting in the collection of CSF or blood around the brain. This can cause severe brain damage by compressing the brain, and a subdural hematoma may develop. Extra-axial fluid collection can be treated in three different ways depending on the severity of the condition. Usually the shunt will be replaced or reprogrammed to release less CSF, and the fluid that has collected around the brain will be drained. The second condition, known as slit ventricle syndrome, occurs when CSF overdrains slowly over several years. More information on slit ventricle syndrome appears below.[10][34]

Chiari I malformation[edit]
Recent studies have shown that over drainage of CSF due to shunting can lead to acquired Chiari I malformation.[35] It was previously thought that Chiari I Malformation was a result of a congenital defect but new studies have shown that overdrainage of Cysto-peritoneal shunts used to treat arachnoid cysts can lead to the development of posterior fossa overcrowding and tonsillar herniation, the latter of which is the classic definition of Chiari Malformation I. Common symptoms include major headaches, hearing loss, fatigue, muscle weakness and loss of cerebellum function.[36]

Slit ventricle syndrome[edit]
Slit ventricle syndrome is an uncommon disorder associated with shunted patients, but results in a large number of shunt revisions. The condition usually occurs several years after shunt implantation. The most common symptoms are similar to normal shunt malfunction, but there are several key differences. First, the symptoms are often cyclical and will appear and then subside several times over a lifetime. Second, the symptoms can be alleviated by lying prone. In the case of shunt malfunction neither time nor postural position will affect the symptoms.[37]
The condition is often thought to occur during a period where overdrainage and brain growth occur simultaneously. In this case, the brain fills the intraventricular space, leaving the ventricles collapsed. Furthermore, the compliance of the brain will decrease, which prevents the ventricles from enlarging, thus reducing the chance for curing the syndrome. The collapsed ventricles can also block the shunt valve, leading to obstruction. Since the effects of slit ventricle syndrome are irreversible, constant care in managing the condition is needed.[34][35]

Intraventricular hemorrhage[edit]
An intraventricular hemorrhage can occur at any time during or after a shunt insertion or revision. Intraparenchymal hemorrhages that are multi-focal in nature have also been described in the pediatric population following ventriculoperitoneal shunting.[38] The hemorrhage can cause an impairment in shunt function which can lead to severe neurological deficiencies.[35] Studies have shown that intraventricular hemorrhage can occur in nearly 31% of shunt revisions.[39]

Outcomes and prognosis[edit]

Though there have been many cases of patients reaching "shunt independence", there is no general agreement among doctors on how to determine which patients might survive without a shunt. It can be very difficult to discern whether a patient could be shunt independent, except under some very specific circumstances. Overall, the permanent removal of a shunt is a rare but not unheard of procedure.[40]

Low pressure hydrocephalusVentricles positionSpecialtyNeurology
Low-pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) is a condition whereby ventricles are enlarged and the individual experiences severe dementia, inability to walk, and incontinence ‚Äì despite very low intracranial pressure (ICP).[1] 
Low pressure hydrocephalus appears to be a more acute form of normal pressure hydrocephalus.  If not diagnosed in a timely fashion, the individual runs the risk of remaining in the low pressure hydrocephalic state or LPHS.  Shunt revisions, even when they are set to drain at a low ICP, are not always effective.  The pressure in the brain does not get high enough to allow the cerebrospinal fluid to drain in a shunt system, therefore the shunt is open, but malfunctioning in LPH. In cases of LPH, chronic infarcts can also develop along the corona radiata in response to the tension in the brain as the ventricles increase in size.  Certain causes of LPH include trauma, tumor, bleeding, inflammation of the lining of the brain, whole brain radiation, as well as other brain pathology that affects the compliance of the brain parenchyma. One treatment for the LPHS is an external ventricular drain (EVD) set at negative pressures.  According to Pang & Altschuler et al.,[citation needed] a controlled, steady, negative pressure siphoning with EVD, carefully monitored with partial computer tomography scans is a safe and effective way of treating LPH.  In their experience, this approach helps restore the brain mantle.  They caution against dropping or raising the pressure of the EVD too quickly as it increases risk and also destabilizes the ventricles.  Getting the ventricles smaller, is the initial step, stabilising them is the second step before placing a shunt ‚Äì which is the final step in therapy.  Any variation from this formula can lead to an ineffective, yet patent shunt system, despite a low-pressure setting.

Tell me about Hydrocephalus. I want to know what it is, how to diagnose it, and how to cure it

# Question

What part of the content below is useful to answer the original request?
Write out the relevant sections verbatim.
If no parts are relevant, respond with just "Irrelevant"

2024/08/23 09:05:44 [Assistant]: Here are my thoughts before answering:

* The original request asks for information on Hydrocephalus, including its definition, diagnosis, and cure.
* The content provided is a Wikipedia article on Low Pressure Hydrocephalus (LPH).
* I need to find relevant information on the definition, diagnosis, and cure of Hydrocephalus in general, rather than just LPH.
* The article mentions that LPH is a form of Hydrocephalus, so I may be able to infer some general information from the article.
* I should look for sections that discuss the general characteristics of Hydrocephalus, as well as the diagnostic and treatment options.

Here are the relevant sections:

* "Low-pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) is a condition whereby ventricles are enlarged and the individual experiences severe dementia, inability to walk, and incontinence ‚Äì despite very low intracranial pressure (ICP)."
* "Low pressure hydrocephalus appears to be a more acute form of normal pressure hydrocephalus."
* "One treatment for the LPHS is an external ventricular drain (EVD) set at negative pressures."
* "Getting the ventricles smaller, is the initial step, stabilising them is the second step before placing a shunt ‚Äì which is the final step in therapy."
* "Care should be taken with EVD therapy, as mismanagement of the EVD can lead to long-term permanent complications and brain injury."

Note that the article does not provide a comprehensive overview of Hydrocephalus, but rather focuses on the specific condition of Low Pressure Hydrocephalus. However, it does provide some general information on the diagnosis and treatment of Hydrocephalus, particularly in the context of LPH.

Cerebrospinal fluidThe cerebrospinal fluid circulates in the subarachnoid space around the brain and spinal cord, and in the ventricles of the brain.Image showing the location of CSF highlighting the brain's ventricular systemDetailsIdentifiersLatinliquor cerebrospinalisAcronym(s)CSFMeSHD002555TA98A14.1.01.203TA25388Anatomical terminology[edit on Wikidata]
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless body fluid found within the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord of all vertebrates.
CSF is produced by specialised ependymal cells in the choroid plexus of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. In humans, there is about 125 mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500 mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a shock absorber, cushion or buffer, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. CSF also serves a vital function in the cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.
CSF occupies the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around and inside the brain and spinal cord. It fills the ventricles of the brain, cisterns, and sulci, as well as the central canal of the spinal cord. There is also a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear via the perilymphatic duct where the perilymph is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid. The ependymal cells of the choroid plexus have multiple motile cilia on their apical surfaces that beat to move the CSF through the ventricles.
A sample of CSF can be taken from around the spinal cord via lumbar puncture. This can be used to test the intracranial pressure, as well as indicate diseases including infections of the brain or the surrounding meninges.
Although noted by Hippocrates, it was forgotten for centuries, though later was described in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg. In 1914, Harvey Cushing demonstrated that CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus.




MRI showing pulsation of CSFDistribution of CSF
In humans, there is about 125‚Äì150 mL of CSF at any one time.[1] This CSF circulates within the ventricular system of the brain. The ventricles are a series of cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two lateral ventricles. From here, CSF passes through the interventricular foramina to the third ventricle, then the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the subarachnoid space through four openings ‚Äì the central canal of the spinal cord, the median aperture, and the two lateral apertures.[1] CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain and spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the sacrum.[1][2] There is a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the perilymph in 93% of people.[3]
CSF moves in a single outward direction from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space.[3] Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart.[3] Some authors dispute this, posing that there is no unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-from cranio-spinal CSF movements.[4]


CSF is derived from blood plasma and is largely similar to it, except that CSF is nearly protein-free compared with plasma and has some different electrolyte levels. Due to the way it is produced, CSF has a lower chloride level than plasma, and a higher sodium level.[2][5]
CSF contains approximately 0.59% plasma proteins, or approximately 15 to 40 mg/dL, depending on sampling site.[6] In general, globular proteins and albumin are in lower concentration in ventricular CSF compared to lumbar or cisternal fluid.[7]  This continuous flow into the venous system dilutes the concentration of larger, lipid-insoluble molecules penetrating the brain and CSF.[8] CSF is normally free of red blood cells and at most contains fewer than 5 white blood cells per mm3 (if the white cell count is higher than this it constitutes pleocytosis and can indicate inflammation or infection).[9]


At around the fifth week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc, covered with ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the notochord. The notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation of the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue.[10] The neural tube, forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior to the development of the choroid plexuses.[3] The open neuropores of the neural tube close after the first month of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.[3]
As the brain develops, by the fourth week of embryological development three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near to where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system: the prosencephalon (forebrain), mesencephalon (midbrain), and rhombencephalon (hindbrain).[10] Subarachnoid spaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day.[3] At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.[3]
The developing forebrain surrounds the neural cord. As the forebrain develops, the neural cord within it becomes a ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a choroid plexus develops, producing and releasing CSF.[10] CSF quickly fills the neural canal.[10] Arachnoid villi are formed around the 35th week of development, with arachnoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.[3]
The subcommissural organ secretes SCO-spondin, which forms Reissner's fiber within CSF assisting movement through the cerebral aqueduct. It is present in early intrauterine life but disappears during early development.[3]



CSF serves several purposes:

Buoyancy: The actual mass of the human brain is about 1400‚Äì1500 grams, but its net weight suspended in CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25‚Äì50 g.[11][1] The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows the brain to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.[5]
Protection: CSF protects the brain tissue from injury when jolted or hit, by providing a fluid buffer that acts as a shock absorber from some forms of mechanical injury.[1][5]
Prevention of brain ischemia: The prevention of brain ischemia is aided by decreasing the amount of CSF in the limited space inside the skull. This decreases total intracranial pressure and facilitates blood perfusion.[1]
Regulation: CSF allows for the homeostatic regulation of the distribution of substances between cells of the brain,[3]  and neuroendocrine factors, to which slight changes can cause problems or damage to the nervous system. For example, high glycine concentration disrupts temperature and blood pressure control, and high CSF pH causes dizziness and fainting.[5]
Clearing waste: CSF allows for the removal of waste products from the brain,[1] and is critical in the brain's lymphatic system, called the glymphatic system.[12] Metabolic waste products diffuse rapidly into CSF and are removed into the bloodstream as CSF is absorbed.[13]  When this goes awry, CSF can become toxic, such as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the most common form of motor neuron disease.[14][15]

The brain produces roughly 500 mL of cerebrospinal fluid per day at a rate of about 20 mL an hour.[17] This transcellular fluid is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 125‚Äì150 mL is present at any one time.[1]
CSF volume is higher on a mL per kg body weight basis in children compared to adults. Infants have a CSF volume of 4 mL/kg, children have a CSF volume of 3 mL/kg, and adults have a CSF volume of 1.5‚Äì2 mL/kg. A high CSF volume is why a larger dose of local anesthetic, on a mL/kg basis, is needed in infants.[18]  Additionally, the larger CSF volume may be one reason as to why children have lower rates of postdural puncture headache.[19]
Most (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is produced by the choroid plexus.[1][2] The choroid plexus is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the four ventricles of the brain. It is present throughout the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct, and the  frontal and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.[20] CSF is mostly produced by the lateral ventricles.[17] CSF is also produced by the single layer of column-shaped ependymal cells which line the ventricles; by the lining surrounding the subarachnoid space; and a small amount directly from the tiny spaces surrounding blood vessels around the brain.[2]
CSF is produced by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space,[1] with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid.[3] This fluid then needs to pass through the epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into CSF by creating osmotic pressure.[3] Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into CSF.[21] Cilia on the apical surfaces of the ependymal cells beat to help transport the CSF.[22]
Water and carbon dioxide from the interstitial fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium.[3] Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen.[2][3] This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into CSF,[2] facilitated by aquaporins.[3] CSF contains many fewer protein anions than blood plasma. Protein in the blood is primarily composed of anions where each anion has many negative charges on it.[23] 
As a result, to maintain electroneutrality blood plasma has a much lower concentration of chloride anions than sodium cations. CSF contains a similar concentration of sodium ions to blood plasma but fewer protein cations and therefore a smaller imbalance between sodium and chloride resulting in a higher concentration of chloride ions than plasma. This creates an osmotic pressure difference with the plasma. CSF has less potassium, calcium, glucose and protein.[5] Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, iodine,[24] vitamins B1, B12, C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and nitric oxide into CSF.[3] A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found on the surface of the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.[3][1]
It has been hypothesised that CSF is not primarily produced by the choroid plexus, but is being permanently produced inside the entire CSF system, as a consequence of water filtration through the capillary walls into the interstitial fluid of the surrounding brain tissue, regulated by AQP-4.[4]
There are circadian variations in CSF secretion, with the mechanisms not fully understood, but potentially relating to differences in the activation of the autonomic nervous system over the course of the day.[3]
Choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle produces CSF from the arterial blood provided by the anterior choroidal artery.[25] In the fourth ventricle, CSF is produced from the arterial blood from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (cerebellopontine angle and the adjacent part of the lateral recess), the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (roof and median opening), and the superior cerebellar artery.[26]


CSF returns to the vascular system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations.[2] These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage.[2] This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses.[3] CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels,[27] particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known,[1] but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate.[3] CSF turns over at a rate of three to four times a day.[2] CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.[3]


The composition and rate of CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF.[3] For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there is less of a pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation.[3] The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system decreasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system increasing it.[3] Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as furosemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.[3]

Clinical significance[edit]


CSF pressure, as measured by lumbar puncture, is 10‚Äì18 cmH2O (8‚Äì15 mmHg or 1.1‚Äì2 kPa) with the patient lying on the side and 20‚Äì30 cmH2O (16‚Äì24 mmHg or 2.1‚Äì3.2 kPa) with the patient sitting up.[28] In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4‚Äì7.3 mmHg or 0.78‚Äì0.98 kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the intracranial pressure.
Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain.[29] Hydrocephalus can occur because of obstruction of the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality.[29][30] Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur.[29] Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired cognition.[30] In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as the bones of the skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness.[30] A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions,[29][30] and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure.[31] Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, which diverts fluid to another part of the body.[29][30]
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a condition of unknown cause characterized by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen optic disc.[29] It can occur in association with the use of vitamin A and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women.[29] Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.[29]



CSF can leak from the dura as a result of different causes such as physical trauma or a lumbar puncture, or from no known cause when it is termed a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak.[32] It is usually associated with intracranial hypotension: low CSF pressure.[31] It can cause headaches, made worse by standing, moving and coughing,[31] as the low CSF pressure causes the brain to "sag" downwards and put pressure on its lower structures.[31] If a leak is identified, a beta-2 transferrin test of the leaking fluid, when positive, is highly specific and sensitive for the detection for CSF leakage.[32] Medical imaging such as CT scans and MRI scans can be used to investigate for a presumed CSF leak when no obvious leak is found but low CSF pressure is identified.[33] Caffeine, given either orally or intravenously, often offers symptomatic relief.[33] Treatment of an identified leak may include injection of a person's blood into the epidural space (an epidural blood patch), spinal surgery, or fibrin glue.[33]


Vials containing human cerebrospinal fluid

CSF can be tested for the diagnosis of a variety of neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture.[34] Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested.[32] About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture,[32] and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.[1]
Testing often includes observing the colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying white and red blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid.[32][34] The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels.[34] A CSF culture may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection,[32] or PCR may be used to identify a viral cause.[34] Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis;[1] and specific antibodies such as aquaporin-4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions.[1] A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus.[1]
Lumbar puncture can also be performed to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of hydrocephalus. However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because it can lead to fatal brain herniation.[32]

Anaesthesia and chemotherapy[edit]

Some anaesthetics and chemotherapy are injected intrathecally into the subarachnoid space, where they spread around CSF, meaning substances that cannot cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier can still be active throughout the central nervous system.[35][36]  Baricity refers to the density of a substance compared to the density of human cerebrospinal fluid and is used in regional anesthesia to determine the manner in which a particular drug will spread in the intrathecal space.[35]


Liquorpheresis is the process of filtering the CSF in order to clear it from endogen or exogen pathogens. It can be achieved by means of fully implantable or extracorporeal devices, though the technique remains experimental today. [37]


CSF drug delivery refers to a number of methods designed to administer therapeutic agents directly into the CSF, bypassing the BBB to achieve higher drug concentrations in the CNS. This technique is particularly beneficial for treating neurological disorders such as brain tumors, infections, and neurodegenerative diseases. Intrathecal injection, where drugs are injected directly into the CSF via the lumbar region, and intracerebroventricular injection, targeting the brain's ventricles, are common approaches. These methods ensure that drugs can reach the CNS more effectively than systemic administration, potentially improving therapeutic outcomes and reducing systemic side effects. Advances in this field are driven by ongoing research into novel delivery systems and drug formulations, enhancing the precision and efficacy of treatments.
Intrathecal pseudodelivery refers to a particular drug delivery method where the therapeutic agent is introduced into a reservoir connected to the intrathecal space, rather than being released into the CSF and distributed throughout the CNS. In this approach, the drug interacts with its target within the reservoir, allowing for changing the composition of the CSF without systemic release. This method can be advantageous for maximizing efficacy and minimizing systemic side effects. 
[38]


Various comments by ancient physicians have been read as referring to CSF. Hippocrates discussed "water" surrounding the brain when describing congenital hydrocephalus, and Galen referred to "excremental liquid" in the ventricles of the brain, which he believed was purged into the nose. But for some 16 intervening centuries of ongoing anatomical study, CSF remained unmentioned in the literature. This is perhaps because of the prevailing autopsy technique, which involved cutting off the head, thereby removing evidence of CSF before the brain was examined.[39]
The modern rediscovery of CSF is credited to Emanuel Swedenborg. In a manuscript written between 1741 and 1744, unpublished in his lifetime, Swedenborg referred to CSF as "spirituous lymph" secreted from the roof of the fourth ventricle down to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. This manuscript was eventually published in translation in 1887.[39]
Albrecht von Haller, a Swiss physician and physiologist, made note in his 1747 book on physiology that the "water" in the brain was secreted into the ventricles and absorbed in the veins, and when secreted in excess, could lead to hydrocephalus.[39] Fran√ßois Magendie studied the properties of CSF by vivisection. He discovered the foramen Magendie, the opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle, but mistakenly believed that CSF was secreted by the pia mater.[39]
Thomas Willis (noted as the discoverer of the circle of Willis) made note of the fact that the consistency of CSF is altered in meningitis.[39] In 1869 Gustav Schwalbe proposed that CSF drainage could occur via lymphatic vessels.[1]
In 1891, W. Essex Wynter began treating tubercular meningitis by removing CSF from the subarachnoid space, and Heinrich Quincke began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.[39] In 1912, a neurologist William Mestrezat gave the first accurate description of the chemical composition of CSF.[39] In 1914, Harvey W. Cushing published conclusive evidence that CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus.[39]


During phylogenesis, CSF is present within the neuraxis before it circulates.[3] The CSF of Teleostei fish, which do not have a subarachnoid space, is contained within the ventricles of their brains.[3] In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, CSF is present in it.[3] Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.[3]
The amount of cerebrospinal fluid varies by size and species.[40] In humans and other mammals, cerebrospinal fluid turns over at a rate of 3‚Äì5 times a day.[40] Problems with CSF circulation, leading to hydrocephalus, can occur in other animals as well as humans.[40]

Tell me about Hydrocephalus. I want to know what it is, how to diagnose it, and how to cure it

# Question

What part of the content below is useful to answer the original request?
Write out the relevant sections verbatim.
If no parts are relevant, respond with just "Irrelevant"

2024/08/23 09:05:47 [Assistant]: Here are my thoughts before answering:

* The original request is about Hydrocephalus, so I should look for relevant information about the condition.
* The content is a long article about cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but it may have sections about Hydrocephalus.
* I should read the content carefully to identify the relevant sections.
* I may need to search for keywords like "Hydrocephalus" or "cerebrospinal fluid circulation" to find the relevant information.
* I should be careful not to include irrelevant information or sections that are not related to the original request.

Here are the relevant sections:

**Hydrocephalus**

Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain.[29] Hydrocephalus can occur because of obstruction of the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality.[29][30] Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur.[29] Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired cognition.[30] In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as the bones of the skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness.[30] A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions,[29][30] and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure.[31] Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, which diverts fluid to another part of the body.[29][30]

**Diagnosis**

Testing often includes observing the colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying white and red blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid.[32][34] The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels.[34] A CSF culture may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection,[32] or PCR may be used to identify a viral cause.[34]

**Treatment**

Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, which diverts fluid to another part of the body.[29][30] Lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure.[31]

Summary

Hydrocephalus is the buildup of too much cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Normally, this fluid cushions your brain. When you have too much, though, it puts harmful pressure on your brain.

Hydrocephalus can be congenital, or present at birth. Causes include genetic problems and problems with how the fetus develops. An unusually large head is the main sign of congenital hydrocephalus.

Hydrocephalus can also happen after birth. This is called acquired hydrocephalus. It can occur at any age. Causes can include head injuries, strokes, infections, tumors, and bleeding in the brain. Symptoms include:
Headache
Vomiting and nausea
Blurry vision
Balance problems
Bladder control problems
Thinking and memory problems


Hydrocephalus can permanently damage the brain, causing problems with physical and mental development. If untreated, it is usually fatal. With treatment, many people lead normal lives with few limitations. Treatment usually involves surgery to insert a shunt. A shunt is a flexible but sturdy plastic tube. The shunt moves the cerebrospinal fluid to another area of the body where it can be absorbed. Medicine and rehabilitation therapy can also help.

Hydrocephalus is a buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to the brain pushing against the skull.Hydrocephalus means "water on the brain."Hydrocephalus is due to a problem with the flow of the fluid that surrounds the brain. This fluid is called the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. The fluid surrounds the brain and spinal cord and helps cushion the brain. CSF normally moves through the brain and around the spinal cord, and then is absorbed into the bloodstream. CSF levels in the brain can rise if: The flow of CSF is blocked.The fluid does not get properly absorbed into the blood.The brain makes too much of the fluid. Too much CSF puts pressure on the brain. This pushes the brain up against the skull and damages brain tissue.Hydrocephalus may begin while the baby is growing in the womb. It is common in babies who have a myelomeningocele, a birth defect in which the spinal column does not close properly. Hydrocephalus may also be due to:Genetic defectsCertain infections during pregnancy In young children, hydrocephalus may be due to:Infections that affect the central nervous system (such as meningitis or encephalitis), especially in infants.Bleeding in the brain during or soon after delivery (especially in premature babies).Injury before, during, or after childbirth, including subarachnoid hemorrhage.Tumors of the central nervous system, including the brain or spinal cord.Injury or trauma. Hydrocephalus most often occurs in children. Another type, called normal pressure hydrocephalus, may occur in adults and older people. Symptoms of hydrocephalus depend on: AgeAmount of brain damageWhat is causing the buildup of CSF fluid In infants, hydrocephalus causes the fontanelle (soft spot) to bulge and the head to be larger than expected. Early symptoms may also include:Eyes that appear to gaze downwardIrritabilitySeizuresSeparated suturesSleepinessVomiting Symptoms that may occur in older children can include:Brief, shrill, high-pitched cryChanges in personality, memory, or the ability to reason or thinkChanges in facial appearance and eye spacingCrossed eyes or uncontrolled eye movementsDifficulty feedingExcessive sleepinessHeadacheIrritability, poor temper controlLoss of bladder control (urinary incontinence)Loss of coordination and trouble walkingMuscle spasticity (spasm)Slow growth (child 0 to 5 years)Slow or restricted movementVomitingThe health care provider will examine the baby. This may show:Stretched or swollen veins on the baby's scalp.Abnormal sounds when the provider taps lightly on the skull, suggesting a problem with the skull bones.All or part of the head may be larger than normal, often the front part.Eyes that look "sunken in."White part of the eye appears over the colored area, making it look like a "setting sun."Reflexes may be normal. Repeated head circumference measurements over time may show that the head is getting bigger.A head CT scan is one of the best tests for identifying hydrocephalus. Other tests that may be done include:ArteriographyBrain scan using radioisotopesCranial ultrasound (an ultrasound of the brain)Lumbar puncture and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (rarely done)Skull x-raysThe goal of treatment is to reduce or prevent brain damage by improving the flow of CSF.Surgery may be done to remove a blockage, if possible.If not, a flexible tube called a shunt may be placed in the brain to reroute the flow of CSF. The shunt sends CSF to another part of the body, such as the belly area, where it can be absorbed.Other treatments may include:Antibiotics if there are signs of infection. Severe infections may require the shunt to be removed.A procedure called endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), which relieves pressure without replacing the shunt.Removing or burning away (cauterizing) the parts of the brain that produce CSF. The child will need regular check-ups to make sure there are no further problems. Tests will be done regularly to check the child's development, and to look for intellectual, neurological, or physical problems.Visiting nurses, social services, support groups, and local agencies can provide emotional support and help with the care of a child with hydrocephalus who has serious brain damage.Without treatment, up to 6 in 10 people with hydrocephalus will die. Those who survive will have different amounts of intellectual, physical, and neurological disabilities.The outlook depends on the cause. Hydrocephalus that is not due to an infection has the best outlook. People with hydrocephalus caused by tumors will often do very poorly.Most children with hydrocephalus who survive for 1 year will have a fairly normal lifespan. The shunt may become blocked. Symptoms of such a blockage include headache and vomiting. Surgeons may be able to help the shunt open without having to replace it.There may be other problems with the shunt, such as kinking, tube separation, or infection in the area of the shunt.Other complications may include:Complications of surgeryInfections such as meningitis or encephalitisIntellectual impairmentNerve damage (decrease in movement, sensation, function)Physical disabilitiesSeek medical care right away if your child has any symptoms of this disorder. Call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the emergency room if emergency symptoms occur, such as:Breathing problemsExtreme drowsiness or sleepinessFeeding difficultiesFeverHigh-pitched cryNo pulse (heartbeat)SeizuresSevere headacheStiff neckVomiting You should also contact your provider if:The child has been diagnosed with hydrocephalus, and the condition gets worse.You are unable to care for the child at home. Protect the head of an infant or child from injury. Prompt treatment of infections and other disorders associated with hydrocephalus may reduce the risk of developing the disorder.

Hydrocephalus is a buildup of spinal fluid inside the fluid chambers of the brain. Hydrocephalus means "water on the brain."Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a rise in the amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain that affects brain function. However, the pressure of the fluid is usually normal.There is no known cause for NPH. But the chance of developing NPH is high in someone who previously had any of the following:Bleeding from a blood vessel or aneurysm in the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage)Certain head injuriesMeningitis or similar infectionsSurgery on the brain (craniotomy)As CSF builds up in the brain, the fluid-filled chambers (ventricles) of the brain swell. This causes pressure on brain tissue. This can damage or destroy parts of the brain.Symptoms of NPH often begin slowly. There are three main symptoms of NPH:Changes in the way a person walks: difficulty when beginning to walk (gait apraxia), feeling as if your feet are stuck to the ground (magnetic gait)Slowing of mental function: forgetfulness, difficulty paying attention, apathy or no moodProblems controlling urine (urinary incontinence), and sometimes controlling stools (bowel incontinence) Diagnosis of NPH can be made if any of the above symptoms occur and NPH is suspected and testing is done.Your health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about the symptoms. If you have NPH, your provider will likely find that your walking (gait) is not normal. You may also have memory problems. Tests that may be done include:Head CT scan or MRI of the headLumbar puncture (spinal tap) with careful testing of walking before and right after the spinal tapTreatment for NPH usually requires surgery to place a tube called a shunt that routes the excess CSF out of the brain ventricles and into the abdomen. This is called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.Without treatment, symptoms often get worse and could lead to death.Surgery improves symptoms in some people. Those with mild symptoms have the best outcome. Walking is the symptom most likely to improve.Problems that may result from NPH or its treatment include:Complications of surgery (infection, bleeding, shunt that does not work well)Loss of brain function (dementia) that becomes worse over timeInjury from fallsShortened life span Contact your provider if:You or a loved one is having increasing problems with memory, walking, or urine incontinence.A person with NPH worsens to the point where you are unable to care for the person yourself. Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if a sudden change in mental status occurs.

**What is Hydrocephalus?**

Hydrocephalus is a buildup of spinal fluid inside the fluid chambers of the brain. Hydrocephalus means "water on the brain." Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a rise in the amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain that affects brain function. However, the pressure of the fluid is usually normal.

**Diagnosis of NPH**

Diagnosis of NPH can be made if any of the above symptoms occur and NPH is suspected and testing is done. Your health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about the symptoms. If you have NPH, your provider will likely find that your walking (gait) is not normal. You may also have memory problems. Tests that may be done include: Head CT scan or MRI of the head, Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) with careful testing of walking before and right after the spinal tap.

**Treatment for NPH**

Treatment for NPH usually requires surgery to place a tube called a shunt that routes the excess CSF out of the brain ventricles and into the abdomen. This is called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is surgery to treat excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the cavities (ventricles) of the brain (hydrocephalus).This procedure is done in the operating room under general anesthesia. It takes about 1 1/2 hours. A thin tube (catheter) is passed from the cavities of the head to the abdomen to drain the excess CSF. A pressure valve and an anti-siphon device ensure that just the right amount of fluid is drained.The procedure is done as follows:An area of hair on the head is shaved. This may be behind the ear or on the top or back of the head.The surgeon makes a skin incision behind the ear. Another small surgical cut is made in the belly.A small hole is drilled in the skull. One end of the catheter is passed into a ventricle of the brain. This can be done with or without a computer as a guide. It can also be done with an endoscope that allows the surgeon to see inside the ventricle.A second catheter is placed under the skin behind the ear. It is sent down the neck and chest, and usually into the belly area. Sometimes, it stops at the chest area. In the belly, the catheter is often placed using an endoscope. The surgeon may also make a few more small cuts, for instance in the neck or near the collarbone, to help pass the catheter under the skin.A valve is placed underneath the skin, usually behind the ear. The valve is connected to both catheters. When extra pressure builds up around the brain, the valve opens, and excess fluid drains through the catheter into the belly or chest area. This helps lower intracranial pressure. A reservoir on the valve allows for priming (pumping) of the valve and for collecting the CSF if needed.The person is taken to a recovery area and then moved to a hospital room. This surgery is done when there is too much CSF in the brain and spinal cord. This is called hydrocephalus. It causes higher than normal pressure on the brain. It can cause brain damage.Children may be born with hydrocephalus. It can occur with other birth defects of the spinal column or brain. Hydrocephalus can also occur in older adults.Shunt surgery should be done as soon as hydrocephalus is diagnosed. Alternative surgeries may be proposed. Your doctor can tell you more about these options.Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:Reactions to medicines or breathing problemsBleeding, blood clots, or infection Risks of ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement are:Blood clot or bleeding in the brainBrain swellingHole in the intestines (bowel perforation), which can occur later after surgeryLeakage of CSF under the skinInfection of the shunt, brain, or in the abdomenDamage to brain tissueSeizures The shunt may stop working. If this happens, fluid will begin to build up in the brain again. As a child grows, the shunt may need to be repositioned.Tell your surgeon or nurse if:You are or could be pregnantYou are taking any medicines, including drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescriptionPlanning for your surgery:If you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon may ask you to see the provider who treats you for these conditions.If you smoke, it's important to cut back or quit. Smoking can slow healing and increase the risk for blood clots. Ask your provider for help quitting smoking.If needed, prepare your home to make it easier to recover after surgery.Ask your surgeon if you need to arrange to have someone drive you home after your surgery.During the week before your surgery:You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.Let your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes COVID-19, a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness. If you do get sick, your surgery may need to be postponed.On the day of surgery:Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time.Follow any other instructions about preparing at home. This may include bathing with a special soap.The person may need to lie flat for 24 hours the first time a shunt is placed.How long the hospital stay is depends on the reason the shunt is needed. The health care team will closely monitor the person. Intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and pain medicines will be given if needed.Follow the surgeon's instructions about how to take care of the shunt at home. This may include taking medicine to prevent infection of the shunt.Shunt placement is usually successful in reducing pressure in the brain. But if hydrocephalus is related to other conditions, such as spina bifida, brain tumor, meningitis, encephalitis, or hemorrhage, these conditions could affect the prognosis. How severe hydrocephalus is before surgery also affects the outcome.Shunt - ventriculoperitoneal; VP shunt; Shunt revisionBadhiwala JH, Kulkarni AV. Ventricular shunting procedures. In: Winn HR, ed.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection is a test to look at the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.CSF acts as a cushion, protecting the brain and spine from injury. The fluid is normally clear. It has the same consistency as water. The test is also used to measure pressure in the spinal fluid.There are different ways to get a sample of CSF. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is the most common method.To have the test:You will lie on your side with your knees pulled up toward the chest, and chin tucked downward. Sometimes the test is done sitting up, but bent forward.After the back is cleaned, the health care provider will inject a local numbing medicine (anesthetic) into the lower spine.A spinal needle will be inserted.An opening pressure is sometimes taken. An abnormal pressure can indicate an infection or other problem.Once the needle is in position, and after the CSF pressure is measured, a sample of 1 to 10 milliliters (mL) of CSF is collected in 4 vials.The needle is removed, the area is cleaned, and a bandage is placed over the needle site. You may be asked to remain lying down for a short time after the test.In some cases, special x-rays are used to help guide the needle into position. This is called fluoroscopy.Lumbar puncture with fluid collection may also be part of other procedures such as an x-ray or CT scan after dye has been inserted into the CSF.Rarely, other methods of CSF collection may be used.Cisternal puncture uses a needle placed below the occipital bone (back of the skull). It can be dangerous because it is so close to the brain stem. It is always done with fluoroscopy or other imaging guidance.Ventricular puncture may be recommended in people with possible brain herniation. It is most often done in the operating room. A hole is drilled in the skull, and a needle is inserted directly into one of the brain's ventricles.CSF may also be collected from a tube that is already placed in the fluid, such as a shunt or a ventricular drain.You will need to give the health care team your consent before the test. Tell your provider if you are on any aspirin or any other blood-thinning medicines.After the procedure, you should plan to rest for several hours, even if you feel fine. This is to prevent fluid from leaking around the site of the puncture. You will not need to lie flat on your back the entire time. If you develop a headache, it may be helpful to drink caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea or soda.It may be uncomfortable to stay in position for the test. Staying still is important because movement may lead to injury of the spinal cord.You may be told to straighten your position slightly after the needle is in place. This is to help measure the CSF pressure.The anesthetic will sting or burn when first injected. There will be a hard pressure sensation when the needle is inserted. Often, there is some brief discomfort when the needle goes through the tissue surrounding the spinal cord. This pain should stop in a few seconds.In most cases, the procedure takes about 30 minutes. The actual pressure measurements and CSF collection only take a few minutes.This test is done to measure pressures within the CSF and to collect a sample of the fluid for further testing.CSF analysis can be used to diagnose certain neurologic disorders. These may include infections (such as meningitis) and brain or spinal cord damage. A spinal tap may also be done to establish the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus or bleeding into the spinal fluid from an aneurysm.Normal values typically range as follows:Pressure: 70 to 180 mm H2OAppearance: clear, colorlessCSF total protein: 15 to 60 mg/100 mL (0.15 to 0.6 g/L)Gamma globulin: 3% to 12% of the total proteinCSF glucose: 50 to 80 mg/100 mL or 2.77 to 4.44 mmol/L (or greater than two thirds of blood sugar level)CSF cell count: 0 to 5 white blood cells (all mononuclear), and no red blood cellsChloride: 110 to 125 mEq/LNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.If the CSF looks cloudy, it could mean there is an infection or a buildup of white blood cells or protein.If the CSF looks bloody or red, it may be a sign of bleeding or spinal cord obstruction. If it is brown, orange, or yellow, it may be a sign of increased CSF protein or previous bleeding (more than 3 days ago). There may be blood in the sample that came from the spinal tap itself. This makes it harder to interpret the test results.CSF PRESSUREIncreased CSF pressure may be due to increased intracranial pressure (pressure within the skull).Decreased CSF pressure may be due to spinal block, dehydration, or CSF leakage.CSF PROTEINIncreased CSF protein may be due to blood in the CSF, diabetes, polyneuritis, tumor, injury, or any inflammatory or infectious condition.Decreased protein is a sign of rapid CSF production or systemic loss of protein.CSF GLUCOSEIncreased CSF glucose is a sign of high blood sugar.Decreased CSF glucose may be due to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), bacterial or fungal infection (such as meningitis), tuberculosis, or certain other types of meningitis.BLOOD CELLS IN CSFIncreased white blood cells in the CSF may be a sign of meningitis, acute infection, beginning of a long-term (chronic) illness, tumor, abscess, or demyelinating disease (such as multiple sclerosis).Red blood cells in the CSF sample may be a sign of bleeding into the spinal fluid or the result of a traumatic lumbar puncture.OTHER CSF RESULTSIncreased CSF gamma globulin levels may be due to diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neurosyphilis, or Guillain-Barr√© syndrome.Additional conditions under which the test may be performed:Chronic inflammatory polyneuropathyDementia due to metabolic causesEncephalitisEpilepsyFebrile seizure (children)Generalized tonic-clonic seizureHydrocephalusNormal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)Pituitary tumorReye syndromeRisks of lumbar puncture include:Bleeding into the spinal canal or around the brain (subdural hematomas).Discomfort during the test.Headache after the test that can last a few hours or days. It may be helpful to drink caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea or soda to help relieve the headache. If headaches last more than a few days (especially when you sit, stand or walk) you might have a CSF-leak. You should talk to your physician if this occurs.Hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to the anesthetic.Infection introduced by the needle going through the skin.Brain herniation may occur if this test is done on a person with a mass in the brain (such as a tumor or abscess). This can result in brain damage or death. This test is not done if an exam or test reveals signs of a brain mass.Damage to the nerves in the spinal cord may occur, particularly if the person moves during the test.Cisternal puncture or ventricular puncture carries additional risks of brain or spinal cord damage and bleeding within the brain.This test is more dangerous for people with:A tumor in the back of the brain that is pressing down on the brainstemBlood clotting problemsLow platelet count (thrombocytopenia)Individuals taking blood thinners, aspirin, clopidogrel, or other similar drugs to decrease the formation of blood clots.

## What is Hydrocephalus?

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a condition in which there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain's ventricles, leading to increased pressure on the brain. It is a type of hydrocephalus, which is a condition where there is an accumulation of CSF in the brain.

## How to Diagnose Hydrocephalus?

This test is done to measure pressures within the CSF and to collect a sample of the fluid for further testing. CSF analysis can be used to diagnose certain neurologic disorders. These may include infections (such as meningitis) and brain or spinal cord damage. A spinal tap may also be done to establish the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus or bleeding into the spinal fluid from an aneurysm.

## How to Cure Hydrocephalus?

There is no cure for hydrocephalus, but treatment can help manage the condition and alleviate symptoms. Treatment options include:

*   Shunting: a surgical procedure where a tube is inserted to drain excess CSF from the brain to another part of the body, such as the abdomen.
*   Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV): a minimally invasive surgical procedure where a small hole is created in the third ventricle to allow CSF to drain.
*   Lumboperitoneal shunting: a surgical procedure where a tube is inserted to drain excess CSF from the brain to the abdomen.

The best course of treatment will depend on the individual's specific needs and the severity of their condition. A healthcare professional will be able to provide more information and guidance on treatment options.

DiagnosisA diagnosis of hydrocephalus is usually based on:

Your symptoms.
A general physical exam.
A neurological exam.
Brain-imaging tests.



Neurological examThe type of neurological exam depends on a person's age. A health care professional might ask questions and conduct simple tests to judge muscle condition, movement, well-being and function of sensory abilities.


Brain imagingImaging tests can help diagnose hydrocephalus. They also can pinpoint underlying causes of symptoms. Imaging tests include:

Ultrasound. This test is often the first test for infants because it's a simple, low-risk procedure. The ultrasound device is placed over the soft spot on the top of the baby's head. Ultrasound also might find hydrocephalus before birth during routine prenatal exams.

MRI. This test uses radio waves and a magnetic field to produce detailed images of the brain. This test is painless, but it is noisy and requires lying still.
MRI scans can show enlarged ventricles caused by excess cerebrospinal fluid. MRI also can be used to find causes of hydrocephalus or other conditions contributing to symptoms.
Children might need medicine to help them feel calm, known as mild sedation, for some MRI scans. However, some hospitals use a fast version of MRI that usually doesn't require sedation.

CT scan. This specialized X-ray technology produces cross-sectional views of the brain. Scanning is painless and quick. But this test also requires lying still, so a child usually receives a mild sedative.
CT scans show less detail than do MRI scans. And CT technology causes exposure to a small amount of radiation. CT scans for hydrocephalus usually are used only for emergency exams.









TreatmentOne of two surgical treatments can be used to treat hydrocephalus.


Shunt
The most common treatment for hydrocephalus is the surgical insertion of a drainage system, called a shunt. It consists of a long, flexible tube with a valve that keeps fluid from the brain flowing in the right direction and at the proper rate.
One end of the tubing is usually placed in one of the brain's ventricles. The tubing is then tunneled under the skin to another part of the body such as the stomach or a heart chamber. This allows excess fluid to be more easily absorbed.
People who have hydrocephalus usually need a shunt system for the rest of their lives. They require regular monitoring.


Endoscopic third ventriculostomySome people may have a surgery called endoscopic third ventriculostomy. The surgeon uses a small video camera to see inside the brain. Then the surgeon makes a hole in the bottom of a ventricle. This allows cerebrospinal fluid to flow out of the brain.


Complications of surgeryBoth surgical procedures can result in complications. Shunt systems can stop draining cerebrospinal fluid. Or shunt systems may poorly regulate drainage because of mechanical problems, a blockage or infections. Complications of ventriculostomy include bleeding and infections.
Complications of surgery require prompt attention. Another surgery or other interventions may be needed. Fever or symptoms of hydrocephalus should prompt an appointment with your health care professional.


Other treatmentsSome people with hydrocephalus, particularly children, might need supportive therapies. Need for these therapies depends on the long-term complications of hydrocephalus.
Children's care teams might include:

Pediatrician or physiatrist, who oversees the treatment plan and medical care.
Pediatric neurologist, who specializes in diagnosing and treating neurological conditions in children.
Occupational therapist, who specializes in therapy to develop everyday skills.
Developmental therapist, who specializes in therapy to help your child develop age-appropriate behaviors, social skills and interpersonal skills.
Mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist.
Social worker, who helps the family get needed services and plan for transitions in care.

Children who are in school may need special education. Special education teachers address learning disabilities, determine educational needs and help find needed resources.
Adults with more serious complications might need the services of occupational therapists or social workers. Or they may need to see specialists in dementia care or other medical specialists.









Clinical trials

Explore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.





Coping and supportWith the help of therapies and educational services, many people with hydrocephalus live with few limitations.
If you have a child with hydrocephalus, there are many resources available to provide emotional and medical support. Children with developmental disabilities might be eligible for government-sponsored health care and other support services. Check with your state or county social services agency.
Hospitals and organizations serving people with disabilities are good resources for emotional and practical support. Members of your health care team also can help. Ask for help connecting with other families who are coping with hydrocephalus.
Adults living with hydrocephalus might find valuable information from organizations dedicated to hydrocephalus education and support, such as the Hydrocephalus Association.


Should you be vaccinated against meningitis?Ask your child's or your health care team if you or your child should receive a vaccine against meningitis, once a common cause of hydrocephalus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends meningitis vaccination for preteen children and boosters for teenagers. Vaccination also is recommended for younger children and adults who might be at increased risk of meningitis for any of the following reasons:

Traveling to countries where meningitis is common.
Having an immune system disease called terminal complement deficiency.
Having a damaged spleen or having had the spleen removed.
Living in a college dormitory.

Preparing for your appointmentThe timing of diagnosing a child with hydrocephalus can depend on how bad the symptoms are and when problems appeared. It also may depend on whether there were risk factors for hydrocephalus during the pregnancy or delivery. Sometimes hydrocephalus can be diagnosed at birth or before birth.


Well-baby visitsIt's important to take your child to all regularly scheduled well-baby visits. Health care professionals monitor your child's development in key areas, including:

Head size, rate of head growth and overall body growth.
Muscle strength and tone.
Coordination.
Posture.
Age-appropriate motor skills.
Sensory abilities such as vision, hearing and touch.

Questions you should be prepared to answer during regular checkups might include:

What concerns do you have about your child's growth or development?
How well does your child eat?
How does your child respond to touch?
Is your child reaching certain milestones in development, such as rolling over, pushing up, sitting up, crawling, walking or speaking?



Preparing for other health care visitsYou'll likely start by seeing your child's or your health care professional. You may then be referred to a doctor who specializes in brain and nervous system conditions, known as a neurologist.
Be prepared to answer the following questions about your symptoms or on your child's behalf:

What symptoms have you noticed? When did they begin?
Have these symptoms changed over time?
Do these symptoms include nausea or vomiting?
Have you or your child had any vision problems?
Have you or your child had a headache or fever?
Have you noticed personality changes, including increased irritability?
Has your child's school performance changed?
Have you noticed new problems with movement or coordination?
Is your child having trouble sleeping or lacking in energy?
Has your infant had seizures?
Has your infant had problems with eating or breathing?
In older children and adults, have symptoms included loss of bladder control and urinating often?
Have you or your child had a recent head injury?
Have you or your child recently begun a new medicine?

OverviewHydrocephalus is the buildup of fluid in cavities called ventricles deep within the brain. The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain.
Cerebrospinal fluid usually flows through the ventricles and bathes the brain and spinal column. But the pressure of too much cerebrospinal fluid can damage brain tissues and cause a range of symptoms related to brain function.
Hydrocephalus can happen at any age, but it occurs more often among infants and among adults 60 and older. Surgery can restore and maintain healthy cerebrospinal fluid levels in the brain. Therapies can manage symptoms resulting from hydrocephalus.










SymptomsThe symptoms of hydrocephalus can vary by age.


InfantsCommon symptoms of hydrocephalus in infants include:
Changes in the head

A head that is larger than usual.
A rapid increase in the size of an infant's head.
A bulge or tense soft spot on the top of the head.

Physical symptoms

Nausea and vomiting.
Sleepiness or sluggishness, known as lethargy.
Irritability.
Poor eating.
Seizures.
Eyes fixed downward, known as sunsetting of the eyes.
Problems with muscle tone and strength.



Toddlers and older childrenAmong toddlers and older children, symptoms might include:
Physical symptoms

Headache.
Blurred or double vision.
Eye movements that are not usual.
Enlargement of a toddler's head.
Sleepiness or sluggishness.
Nausea or vomiting.
Trouble with balance.
Poor coordination.
Poor appetite.
Loss of bladder control or urinating often.

Behavioral and cognitive changes

Irritability.
Change in personality.
Decline in school performance.
Delays or problems with earlier gained skills, such as walking or talking.



Young and middle-aged adultsCommon symptoms in this age group include:

Headache.
Sluggishness.
Loss of coordination or balance.
Loss of bladder control or needing to urinate often.
Vision problems.
Decline in memory, concentration and other thinking skills that may affect job performance.



Older adultsAmong adults 60 and older, the more common symptoms of hydrocephalus are:

Loss of bladder control or needing to urinate often.
Memory loss.
Progressive loss of other thinking or reasoning skills.
Trouble walking, often described as shuffling or the feeling of the feet being stuck.
Poor coordination or balance.



When to see a doctorSeek emergency medical care for infants and toddlers with these symptoms:

A high-pitched cry.
Problems with sucking or feeding.
Recurrent vomiting with no clear cause.
Seizures.

Seek prompt medical attention for other hydrocephalus symptoms in any age group.
More than one condition can cause the problems associated with hydrocephalus. It's important to get a timely diagnosis and appropriate care.

Causes
Hydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance between how much cerebrospinal fluid is produced and how much is absorbed into the bloodstream.
Tissues lining the ventricles of the brain produce cerebrospinal fluid. It flows through the ventricles by way of channels. The fluid eventually flows into spaces around the brain and spinal column. It's absorbed primarily by blood vessels in tissues on the surface of the brain.
Cerebrospinal fluid plays an important role in brain function by:

Allowing the relatively heavy brain to float within the skull.
Cushioning the brain to prevent injury.
Removing waste products of the brain's metabolism.
Flowing back and forth between the brain cavity and spinal column. This flow maintains a constant pressure within the brain and allows for changes in blood pressure in the brain.

Too much cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles can occur for one of the following reasons:

Obstruction. Partial blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid is the most common cause of too much cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles. A blockage may happen from one ventricle to another or from the ventricles to other spaces around the brain.
Poor absorption. Less common is a problem with absorbing cerebrospinal fluid. This is often related to inflammation of brain tissues from disease or injury.
Overproduction. Rarely, cerebrospinal fluid is created more quickly than it can be absorbed.



Risk factorsMuch of the time, the cause of hydrocephalus is not known. However, developmental or medical problems can contribute to or trigger hydrocephalus.


NewbornsHydrocephalus may be present at or before birth, known as congenital hydrocephalus. Or it can occur shortly after birth. Any of the following incidents may cause hydrocephalus in newborns:

The central nervous system developed in a way that blocks the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.
Bleeding occurred within the ventricles. This is a possible complication of premature birth.
There was an infection in the uterus during pregnancy, such as rubella or syphilis. An infection can cause swelling in the brain tissues of an unborn baby.



Other contributing factorsOther factors that can contribute to hydrocephalus among any age group include:

Tumors of the brain or spinal cord.
Central nervous system infections, such as bacterial meningitis or mumps.
Bleeding in the brain from a stroke or head injury.
Other traumatic injury to the brain.



ComplicationsIn most cases, hydrocephalus worsens. Without treatment, hydrocephalus leads to complications. Complications may include learning disabilities or developmental and physical disabilities. Complications of this condition also can result in death. When hydrocephalus is mild and it's treated, there may be few, if any, serious complications.

Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) can be debilitating for people over age 60, yet it is underdiagnosed. Mayo Clinic is using cutting-edge technology to improve diagnosis and treatment approaches for this reversible condition.









"Right now, we're diagnosing this condition only in people with pretty severe symptoms, who may not get full recovery. We're hoping to pick up the diagnosis much sooner, so we can treat more patients."








The efforts involve sophisticated gait assessment, imaging and artificial intelligence. The goal is to better predict who might benefit from shunting.
"If the condition is caught early enough and patients undergo ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, the symptoms can improve. Some individuals are even cured temporarily," says Olga P. Fermo, M.D., a neurologist and medical director of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) clinic at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.
Other efforts focus on improving surgical techniques. Mayo Clinic performs shunt placement laparoscopically. Research is also underway on technical innovations that could further reduce the invasiveness of shunt surgery.
"The surgery has stayed largely the same, with only minor variations, over the last 50 years. But we have had a lot of success with laparoscopic procedures," Dr. Elder says. "We end up with a much smaller incision and less risk of surgical complications, of the catheter being pulled out later, and probably also a lower risk of the catheter becoming obstructed."


Seeking diagnostic and prognostic markersAs many as 3% of individuals over age 60 might have iNPH. Untreated, the condition can cause gait disturbance, urinary incontinence and cognitive dysfunction. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical exam, MRI findings of ventricular dilation, CSF removal testing and gait assessment.



"We have developed a dedicated iNPH imaging protocol that provides multifaceted data and may help in diagnosis of challenging cases," says Petrice M. Cogswell, M.D., Ph.D., a neuroradiologist at Mayo Clinic's campus in Minnesota. "Increased awareness of imaging features associated with iNPH ‚Äî specifically, disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus (DESH) ‚Äî will help identify more individuals with this condition."
Comprehensive gait evaluations are performed before and after treatment. "The gait mat in our CSF clinic can record every aspect of gait and balance possible ‚Äî step placement, step height and length, gait velocity, and stability," Dr. Fermo says.
Clinicians also collaborate with the Motion Analysis Laboratory at Mayo Clinic's campus in Minnesota. That teamwork between physicians and biomedical engineers facilitates optimal clinical decision-making and innovation.
"The lab provides highly detailed assessments of gait patterns to predict who might benefit from shunting. That information helps us to dial in the optimal shunt settings and to closely track improvements in walking over time," Dr. Elder says.
Mayo Clinic researchers are using gait assessment data to discern patterns associated with iNPH. The researchers also are applying artificial intelligence to pre-surgical and post-surgical imaging data to identify imaging markers of individuals who respond to shunt placement.
Other research efforts include:

Analysis of genetic profiles of individuals with normal-pressure hydrocephalus.
Participation in the multicenter Efficacy in iNPH Shunting (PENS) Trial, which is funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
Development of a test for axial movements in the horizontal position, as a potential prognostic indicator for shunt surgery.
Investigation of the prognostic value of amyloid imaging before shunt surgery.
Evaluation of the effectiveness of magnetic resonance elastography as an imaging modality for hydrocephalus.
Characterization of serum and CSF biomarker profiles before and after shunt placement.

The scale of these efforts underlines Mayo Clinic's commitment to improving care for people with iNPH. Dr. Elder recalls two individuals he learned of during training who had symptoms of the condition. One was a 75-year-old marathon runner who was able only to jog occasionally. The other was a chief executive who had to retire due to inability to manage the business. Neither person had a diagnosis of iNPH after standard assessments.
"These individuals were clearly symptomatic of hydrocephalus, but our testing is too crude to pick up the subtleties of diagnosis," Dr. Elder says. "We diagnose only a small fraction of cases of a significantly debilitating condition. That has to improve."

Here are my thoughts before answering:

* The original request is asking for a comprehensive overview of Hydrocephalus, which suggests that I should provide a broad and detailed explanation.
* The content provided is a long article about Hydrocephalus, which suggests that I should be able to find relevant information in the article.
* I should look for sections that explain what Hydrocephalus is, how it is diagnosed, and how it is treated.
* I should also consider the tone and language used in the article, which appears to be formal and informative.

Here are the relevant sections:

**What is Hydrocephalus?**

Hydrocephalus is a condition in which an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) occurs within the brain. This typically causes increased pressure inside the skull. Older people may have headaches, double vision, poor balance, urinary incontinence, personality changes, or mental impairment. In babies, it may be seen as a rapid increase in head size. Other symptoms may include vomiting, sleepiness, seizures, and downward pointing of the eyes.

**Diagnosis**

Diagnosis is typically made by physical examination and medical imaging. The four types of hydrocephalus are communicating, noncommunicating, ex vacuo, and normal pressure.

**Treatment**

Hydrocephalus is typically treated by the surgical placement of a shunt system. A procedure called a third ventriculostomy is an option in some people. Complications from shunts may include overdrainage, underdrainage, mechanical failure, infection, or obstruction. This may require replacement. Outcomes are variable, but many people with shunts live normal lives. Without treatment, permanent disability or death may occur.

**Types of Hydrocephalus**

Communicating hydrocephalus, also known as nonobstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by impaired CSF reabsorption in the absence of any obstruction of CSF flow between the ventricles and subarachnoid space. Noncommunicating hydrocephalus, or obstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by an obstruction to the flow of CSF.

**Treatment Options**

In the short term, an external ventricular drain (EVD), also known as an extraventricular drain or ventriculostomy, provides relief. In the long term, some people will need any of various types of cerebral shunt. It involves the placement of a ventricular catheter (a tube made of silastic) into the cerebral ventricles to bypass the flow obstruction/malfunctioning arachnoidal granulations and drain the excess fluid into other body cavities, from where it can be resorbed.
===============
[Normal pressure hydrocephalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_pressure_hydrocephalus)
Thoughts before answering:

* The original request is broad and asks for a comprehensive overview of Hydrocephalus.
* The content provided is a Wikipedia article on Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), which is a specific type of Hydrocephalus.
* The content may not cover other types of Hydrocephalus.
* The article provides information on diagnosis and treatment, but it may not be a comprehensive overview of all aspects of Hydrocephalus.
* The article is focused on NPH, so it may not be directly applicable to other types of Hydrocephalus.

Relevant sections:

* The introduction to the article provides a general overview of Hydrocephalus, stating that it is a condition where excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the brain, leading to increased pressure.
* The section on "Causes of Hydrocephalus" provides a brief overview of the underlying mechanisms that lead to Hydrocephalus, including an imbalance between CSF production and absorption.
* The section on "Diagnosis of Hydrocephalus" provides information on how to diagnose NPH, including the use of imaging studies and lumbar punctures.
* The section on "Treatment of Hydrocephalus" provides information on how to treat NPH, including the use of ventriculoperitoneal shunts.

Verbatim sections:

Hydrocephalus is a condition where excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the brain, leading to increased pressure.

Hydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance between the amount of fluid produced and its absorption rate. Enlarged ventricles put increased pressure on the adjacent cortical tissue and cause myriad effects in the patient, including distortion of the fibers in the corona radiata. This leads to an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). The ICP gradually falls but remains slightly elevated, and the CSF pressure reaches a high normal level of 15 to 20 cm H2O.

Diagnosis of Hydrocephalus is typically made using imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans. These studies can show enlarged ventricles and no macroscopic obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid flow.

Treatment of Hydrocephalus typically involves the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to drain excess CSF from the brain to the peritoneal cavity. The shunt is adjusted to allow for fine-tuning of CSF drainage, and the patient is monitored for improvement in symptoms.

**Diagnoses**

Description

Incidence


Congenital hydrocephalus

A wide range of genetic abnormalities that could lead to hydrocephalus at birth.

0.04‚Äì0.08%[14]


Tumor

A number of different tumors can lead to CSF blockage if they are located in certain areas. Some of these areas include the lateral or third ventricles, the posterior fossa, and intraspinal tumors. The tumors may be malignant or benign.[15]

Unknown


Post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus

Bleeding into the ventricles of the brain, especially in infancy, can lead to blockage of CSF drainage and cause hydrocephalus.


Spina bifida

Specifically spina bifida myelomeningocele can cause the development of hydrocephalus because the cerebellum will block the flow of CSF in a development of Chiari Malformation II.

0.125%[16]


Congenital aqueductal stenosis

A genetic disorder which can cause deformations of the nervous system. The defect is commonly associated with intellectual disability, abducted thumbs and spastic paraplegia.[14]

0.003%[14]


Craniosynostosis

Craniosynostosis occurs when the sutures of the skull close too early. The result of multiple sutures fusing before the brain stops growing is an increase in ICP leading to hydrocephalus.[17]

0.05%[18]


Post-meningitic hydrocephalus

The inflammation and scarring caused by meningitis can inhibit CSF absorption.


Dandy‚ÄìWalker syndrome

Patients usually present with a cystic deformity of the fourth ventricle, hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, and an enlarged posterior fossa. The condition is a genetically heritable disease.[19]

0.003%[20]


Arachnoid cyst

A defect caused when CSF forms a collection that is trapped in the arachnoid membranes. The resulting cyst can then block the normal flow of CSF from the brain resulting in hydrocephalus as well as other defects. The most common locations for an arachnoid cyst are the middle fossa and the posterior fossa. The most common symptoms are nausea and vertigo.[21]

**Hydrocephalus**

Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain.[29] Hydrocephalus can occur because of obstruction of the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality.[29][30] Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur.[29] Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired cognition.[30] In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as the bones of the skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness.[30] A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions,[29][30] and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure.[31] Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, which diverts fluid to another part of the body.[29][30]

**Diagnosis**

Testing often includes observing the colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying white and red blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid.[32][34] The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels.[34] A CSF culture may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection,[32] or PCR may be used to identify a viral cause.[34]

**Treatment**

Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, which diverts fluid to another part of the body.[29][30] Lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure.[31]

**Summary**

Hydrocephalus is the buildup of too much cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Normally, this fluid cushions your brain. When you have too much, though, it puts harmful pressure on your brain.

**Hydrocephalus can be congenital, or present at birth. Causes include genetic problems and problems with how the fetus develops. An unusually large head is the main sign of congenital hydrocephalus.**

**Hydrocephalus can also happen after birth. This is called acquired hydrocephalus. It can occur at any age. Causes can include head injuries, strokes, infections, tumors, and bleeding in the brain. Symptoms include:**

* Headache
* Vomiting and nausea
* Blurry vision
* Balance problems
* Bladder control problems
* Thinking and memory problems

**Hydrocephalus can permanently damage the brain, causing problems with physical and mental development. If untreated, it is usually fatal. With treatment, many people lead normal lives with few limitations. Treatment usually involves surgery to insert a shunt. A shunt is a flexible but sturdy plastic tube. The shunt moves the cerebrospinal fluid to another area of the body where it can be absorbed. Medicine and rehabilitation therapy can also help.**

* To answer the original request, I will need to identify the relevant sections of the content that cover each of these topics.

The relevant sections are:

**What it is:**
Hydrocephalus is a buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to the brain pushing against the skull. Hydrocephalus means "water on the brain." Hydrocephalus is due to a problem with the flow of the fluid that surrounds the brain. This fluid is called the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. The fluid surrounds the brain and spinal cord and helps cushion the brain. CSF normally moves through the brain and around the spinal cord, and then is absorbed into the bloodstream. CSF levels in the brain can rise if: The flow of CSF is blocked. The fluid does not get properly absorbed into the blood. The brain makes too much of the fluid.

**How to diagnose it:**
The health care provider will examine the baby. This may show: Stretched or swollen veins on the baby's scalp. Abnormal sounds when the provider taps lightly on the skull, suggesting a problem with the skull bones. All or part of the head may be larger than normal, often the front part. Eyes that look "sunken in." White part of the eye appears over the colored area, making it look like a "setting sun." Reflexes may be normal. Repeated head circumference measurements over time may show that the head is getting bigger. A head CT scan is one of the best tests for identifying hydrocephalus. Other tests that may be done include: Arteriography. Brain scan using radioisotopes. Cranial ultrasound (an ultrasound of the brain). Lumbar puncture and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (rarely done). Skull x-rays.

**How to cure it:**
The goal of treatment is to reduce or prevent brain damage by improving the flow of CSF. Surgery may be done to remove a blockage, if possible. If not, a flexible tube called a shunt may be placed in the brain to reroute the flow of CSF. The shunt sends CSF to another part of the body, such as the belly area, where it can be absorbed. Other treatments may include: Antibiotics if there are signs of infection. Severe infections may require the shunt to be removed. A procedure called endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), which relieves pressure without replacing the shunt. Removing or burning away (cauterizing) the parts of the brain that produce CSF.

**What is Hydrocephalus?**

Hydrocephalus is a buildup of spinal fluid inside the fluid chambers of the brain. Hydrocephalus means "water on the brain." Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a rise in the amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain that affects brain function. However, the pressure of the fluid is usually normal.

**Diagnosis of NPH**

Diagnosis of NPH can be made if any of the above symptoms occur and NPH is suspected and testing is done. Your health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about the symptoms. If you have NPH, your provider will likely find that your walking (gait) is not normal. You may also have memory problems. Tests that may be done include: Head CT scan or MRI of the head, Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) with careful testing of walking before and right after the spinal tap.

**Treatment for NPH**

Treatment for NPH usually requires surgery to place a tube called a shunt that routes the excess CSF out of the brain ventricles and into the abdomen. This is called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

## What is Hydrocephalus?

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a condition in which there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain's ventricles, leading to increased pressure on the brain. It is a type of hydrocephalus, which is a condition where there is an accumulation of CSF in the brain.

## How to Diagnose Hydrocephalus?

This test is done to measure pressures within the CSF and to collect a sample of the fluid for further testing. CSF analysis can be used to diagnose certain neurologic disorders. These may include infections (such as meningitis) and brain or spinal cord damage. A spinal tap may also be done to establish the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus or bleeding into the spinal fluid from an aneurysm.

## How to Cure Hydrocephalus?

There is no cure for hydrocephalus, but treatment can help manage the condition and alleviate symptoms. Treatment options include:

*   Shunting: a surgical procedure where a tube is inserted to drain excess CSF from the brain to another part of the body, such as the abdomen.
*   Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV): a minimally invasive surgical procedure where a small hole is created in the third ventricle to allow CSF to drain.
*   Lumboperitoneal shunting: a surgical procedure where a tube is inserted to drain excess CSF from the brain to the abdomen.

The best course of treatment will depend on the individual's specific needs and the severity of their condition. A healthcare professional will be able to provide more information and guidance on treatment options.
